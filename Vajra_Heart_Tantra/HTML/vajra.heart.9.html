      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The cause, vital 
      force, and life of the impure cycle of existence and the miserable states 
      of existence is self-grasping, so the realization of identitylessness is 
      the transmission on the life of samsara. The nonconceptual, primordial 
      wisdom of reality-itself dispels the taints of afflictive and cognitive 
      obscurations into the absolute nature. That purification is the cleansing 
      transmission on the removal of the habitual propensities of those two 
      obscurations. Conventionally, by revealing the practice of deliverance, 
      deliverance is possible. But all enemies and malevolent beings are 
      self-appearances, delusive apparitions of conceptualization. Their 
      deliverance, too, is an appearance of conceptualization, so that is the 
      meaning of the ability to deliver them.&nbsp; Moreover, their deliverance is 
      merely the appearance of their being liberated. Summoning is also revealed 
      as gaining mastery over appearances. [259] As for binding, ultimately one 
      is bound by the cord of awareness. Conventionally, red light in the form 
      of cords is emitted from the heart of the being in front of you, 
      completely tying up and firmly binding the life force, life, and vitality 
      and the body, speech, and mind of your enemies and malevolent beings. All 
      their strength and ability to rise up and move about is constrained and 
      subdued, and you imagine them as if they were a corpse cast upon a plain.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for isolating your 
      [enemies from their protective] gods, this is the method for isolating 
      inborn, primordial wisdom from the habitual propensities of ignorance, 
      which become conflated, and for causing primordial wisdom to become 
      manifest. That is ultimate reality. In terms of conventional reality, upon 
      a drub kung place two feathers and imagine them as the owl-faced protector 
      Tramen and as a crow-faced Tramen having a woman's body with wings and 
      feathers. Imagine them emitting a foul odor that causes the gods of your 
      enemies and malevolent beings to become intoxicated, fall unconscious, and 
      be driven away. As those two are emitting their own calls, they set to 
      fighting on </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 177 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">the face of the drub 
      kung and the fluttering of their wings causes all the protective gods who 
      guard your enemies, to faint, leaving your enemies and malevolent beings 
      stranded. Innumerable, terrifying replicas of the two Tramen are emanated 
      from them, and they claw at [your enemies], flail their wings, [260] and 
      rip at them with their beaks. As they are being devoured, they are 
      banished into the darkness inside a mountain on an island on the far side 
      of the ocean. Imagine that they are so dazed that they cannot return, and 
      while reciting the mantra, flail them with a feather and fumigate them 
      with substances. That is the way to expel them with substances, mantras, 
      and samadhi. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately entering a 
      state of intoxication is revealed as means for arousing a sense of violent 
      joy before mental afflictions, karma, and habitual propensities have been 
      dispelled. Conventionally, you unify all the karmic energies of all 
      sentient beings of the three realms, which, in the form of blackness, 
      enters through the tips of the ring-fingers of your enemies and malevolent 
      beings. It then passes inside the vitality-channel, and by the power of 
      its movement, you imagine that they become intoxicated and pass out. That 
      visualization is the crucial aspect of this samadhi. Ferocious mantras 
      such as jva la pa ya are the crucial aspect of the mantras, and fumigation 
      with intoxicating incense is the crucial aspect of the substances. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Pulverizing in the 
      mortar demonstrates that ultimately by the great power of nondual method 
      and wisdom, the rudra of the view of the self is released to the point of 
      vanishing altogether. Conventionally, in the mortar of the vagina of the 
      Black, Female Wrathful Rolje all the forms, aggregates, elements, and 
      sense-bases of your enemies and malevolent beings are gathered. [261] 
      Hammered with the flaming vajra-pestle, the wrathful, crushing, supreme 
      method, they are pulverized into fine particles. Know that imagining that 
      is the gist&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page178 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">of the samadhi, the 
      mortar and pestle are the essential substances, and the mantra ta tha ya 
      and so forth is the essential mantra.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">By apprehending for 
      yourself the dharmakaya, the awareness that is present as the ground, the 
      siddhi of the four embodiments and the five primordial wisdoms is achieved 
      effortlessly; and that is the ultimate reality. Transforming siddhis into 
      the spiritual path in dependence upon substances is taught as skillful 
      means and as an auspicious act. In reality , even though you have mastered 
      the dharmakaya, the awareness that is present as the ground, residual 
      appearances and mental states of samsara may still be present. By 
      fathoming its inner depths and perfecting its power, they vanish into 
      reality itself. Conventionally, the remains of the ganacakra are offered 
      to the apparitional guests, the guardians of the remains. That is taught 
      simply as skillful means and as an auspicious act. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Just as the 
      aggregations of karma and mental afflictions and the array of thoughts of 
      the three times are vanquished by the power of natural liberation, by 
      summoning your enemies and malevolent beings to the torma, and 
      annihilating them with the visualization techniques, their life and merit 
      dissolves into yourself; their consciousness dissolves into the heart of 
      your principle chosen deity; [262] and their flesh, blood, and bones turn 
      into ambrosia. The assembly of haughty guardians of the doctrine gobble 
      them up, and they obey your commands for their actions. That visualization 
      is taught as a conventional reality. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Mundane existence that 
      occurs in the natural order of dependent origination consists of displays 
      of empty awareness, reality-itself. The Great Mother that realizes the 
      reversed order of the twelve links of dependent origination, the twelve 
      aspects of emptiness, is the manifestation of the absolute nature of the 
      dharmakaya; and that is ultimate reality. The inexhaustible tormas&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 179 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">visualized as 
      wish-fulfilling ambrosia are offered to the matrka-drdhas, and they are 
      commanded to engage in the enlightened activities of protecting the 
      doctrine; and that is conventional reality. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the doctrine, 
      the source of all the Dharmas of scriptures and of realization is the 
      nature of being of suchness, reality-itself. All misconceptions, evils, 
      and arrays of afflictive thoughts are confined in the drub kung of 
      equality, the emptiness of samsara and nirvana; and they are overwhelmed 
      by the power of the displays of primordial wisdom. That is the ultimate 
      reality. Imagine that in the space of the black wind from the underlying 
      ground, the blazing opening of the triangular, metal structure of the 
      belly of the Lord of Death, Karmayama, suddenly gapes open. Innumerable 
      emanations of the enlightened activities of all the jinas of the three 
      times instantly and inexorably summon all the damsis, gabs, and pisacas, 
      like dust blown away by the wind. [263] As soon as they are cast inside 
      the drub kung, its surface closes over them, so that there is no chance of 
      their escaping. Swooning into a state of bliss, they remain for a hundred 
      eons, with no compulsive ideation arising in their mind-streams. Imagine 
      the viras and viras emanated by the jinas dancing [upon the drub kung], 
      and overcoming all types of roots of afflictions so that they can never 
      arise again. That is conventional reality. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately, virtue has 
      never been committed, the object of dedication is not established, and the 
      agent who dedicates is not established. There is one taste in the display 
      of great, pervasive reality-itself, so all collections of merit and 
      knowledge are left in a self-arisen, spontaneously perfected state; and 
      there is no dedication that is established apart from that. 
      Conventionally, all the collections of merit you have accumulated during 
      the three times are unified, and you should dedicate them--just as all the 
      jinas of the three times have dedicated and will dedicate--as causes for 
      the attainment of the state of Awakening of perfect&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 180 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">omniscience for all 
      sentient beings without bias in terms of time or space.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">&nbsp;[264] As for prayers, 
      in reality no object of prayers is established apart from gaining mastery 
      over the self-arisen, original state of the Protector. Conventionally, you 
      should pray that all sentient beings may attain the state of Awakening of 
      perfect omniscience. Ultimately, the perfection of all superb 
      qualities--such as serenity, coolness, limpidity , and freedom from 
      contamination--of great equality of primordially pure reality-itself is 
      its auspicious, essential nature. Accordingly, all the jinas and 
      jinaputras of the ten directions arise from the absolute nature of reality 
      as beautiful appearances of rupakayas. They perform auspicious dances in 
      the sky and with the melodious speech of Brahma they utter verses of 
      auspiciousness. Their minds are mercifully set on granting the glories of 
      such benefits to all sentient beings. A rain of various, lovely, 
      auspicious flowers falls from their hands. That visualization is taught as 
      being of the nature of conventional, skillful means. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately, in the 
      signless dharmakaya, the emanation and retraction of the displays of the 
      whole of samsara and nirvana are not established. Conventionally, the 
      stage of generation does not mistakenly slip into reification; [265] and 
      it dispels the extreme of a substantialist view. The stage of generation, 
      involving objects of attention with signs, is taught as a method for 
      manifesting objectless, primordially pure, enlightened awareness, free of 
      conceptual elaboration, and as a method for realizing the cycle of 
      existence of the three realms to be like an illusion and a dream. Just as 
      the pure appearances of primordial wisdom deities previously arose in 
      their natural order from their causal syllables, so do they revert back 
      into the state of reality-itself, suchness. Alternatively, all the 
      displays of the buddha-fields withdraw into the palace; the palace 
      withdraws into&nbsp; the assembly of deities; the entire assembly of deities 
      withdraws into the absolute nature of the principle deity; the principle 
      deity withdraws into the mantra-circle;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 181 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">the mantra-circle 
      withdraws into the hum; the hum dissolves into the crescent moon, which 
      dissolves into the bindu, which dissolves into the nada. Then the nada is 
      withdrawn into the absolute nature of reality. By remaining as long as you 
      can in meditative equipoise in the state of pervasive emptiness, free of 
      conceptual elaboration, the deities of meditative equipoise are withdrawn 
      into the absolute nature. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately, there is 
      nothing for self-cognizing awareness to generate or visualize as the 
      divine displays of original, primordial wisdom. As for that method: 
      instantaneously from the state of the absolute nature of reality , 
      emptiness free of conceptual elaboration-like [266] the sudden&nbsp; appearance 
      of a rainbow even though no rainbow exists in the sky, and like the sudden 
      appearance of bubbles in water in which no bubbles exist--in that very 
      instant, from the absolute nature of emptiness you suddenly visualize 
      yourself as an assembly of primordial wisdom deities. Rays of light 
      emanate from your three places, drawing in all the inexhaustible circles 
      of ornaments of all the bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and enlightened 
      activities of all the jinas and jinaputras of the ten directions in the 
      forms of white syllables om, red ah, and blue hum. As a result, imagine 
      that your body is clothed in tightly woven vajra-armor, which cannot be 
      pierced or destroyed. Never being separated from divine pride is called 
      the path of conventional, skillful means.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately, there is 
      no invocation or coming and going of the deities. By manifesting the 
      self-arisen face of the ground-absolute nature as the spontaneous displays 
      of the three embodiments, thoughts of ignorance are banished into 
      oblivion. In general, all enemies and malevolent beings are nothing other 
      than apparitions of thoughts of your own mind, and deities fabricated by 
      thoughts arise as appearances to liberate you. As an analogy, one may 
      prepare a powder of various grasses, wood, flowers, minerals, flesh, 
      [267]&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 182 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">and blood intended as 
      a remedy for an illness. With the healer's firm intention to benefit, and 
      the patient's unwavering conviction that it will relieve the pain of the 
      illness, an appearance of benefit certainly arises.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Conventionally, due to 
      anxiety about being harmed by enemies and malevolent beings, in response 
      to enemies and malevolent beings arising as aggressors, you emanate 
      countless rays of light from your heart as your chosen deity. They invoke 
      the jinas and jinaputras of the ten directions and the three times from 
      the absolute nature of reality in the forms of terrifying rupakayas. With 
      weapons and magical substances, they apply themselves to the tasks of 
      summoning and delivering all the evil enemies and malevolent beings. This 
      is analogous to taking revenge on one's enemy by sending an army against 
      him. Likewise, [those rupakayas] fill all the realms of the universe, 
      inexorably surrounding your enemies and malevolent beings, like dear 
      driven into an enclosure; and you imagine them vigorously killing and 
      mutilating them. Like a king arousing and summoning his troops and giving 
      them their wages, you imagine tormas turning into inexhaustible ambrosia 
      of primordial wisdom of the nature of mountains of flesh and oceans of 
      blood; and you dedicate that. [268] As for reversal, ultimately, all 
      enemies and malevolent beings of mental afflictions are reversed back to 
      intangible, nonobjective displays of reality-itself. That is done to 
      manifest the primordial wisdom of awareness. In accordance with that 
      method, from the heart and all other places of the deity visualized in 
      front of you are emanated a malodorous mass of flames and assemblies of 
      wrathful beings with iron scorpions, various weapons, and magical 
      substances spreading everywhere throughout all the realms of the universe. 
      These wrathful beings and their assistants deliver up all enemies and 
      malevolent beings. They hack them up with various weapons. Many garudas 
      and iron scorpions devour them, the remains are incinerated in a blaze of 
      fire, and they are dispersed by a&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 183 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">razor-wind. Their 
      consciousnesses are delivered into the absolute nature in which delusion 
      is impossible, leaving not even a trace behind. That visualization is 
      taught as a conventional path of skillful means.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately, 
      ontological and phenomenological wisdom and great primordial wisdom, like 
      the conflagration at the end of the eon, incinerate all mental states and 
      mental factors. Like burning kindling in a fire, all adventitious 
      contaminations are incinerated in the state of awareness that transcends 
      causality. To indicate that method by way of an analogy, first of all 
      bhrum [269] turns into a dark blue tongue of fire of the nature of the 
      primordial wisdom of the absolute nature of reality in the center; in the 
      east it turns into a white tongue of fire of the nature of mirror-like 
      primordial wisdom; in the south it turns into a yellow tongue of fire of 
      the nature of the primordial wisdom of equality; in the west it turns into 
      a red tongue of fire of the nature of the primordial wisdom of 
      discernment; and in the north it turns into a blazing, dark green tongue 
      of fire of the nature of the primordial wisdom of accomplishment.<br>
      Imagine pacification as round, increase as square, power as semicircular, 
      and spontaneity as octagonal. Also imagine pacification as a white palace 
      of fire, increase as yellow, power as red, ferocity as green or blue- 
      green, and spontaneity as dark blue or multicolored. For all those, know 
      that their essential nature is primordial wisdom, while their form is 
      palaces of the nature of tongues of fire. In their center, imagine the 
      time of pacification in the morning as being of the nature of a white 
      assembly of deities; the time of increase at noon as a yellow assembly of 
      deities; the time of power in the evening as a red assembly of deities; 
      and the time of ferocity at dusk as being of the nature of a green 
      assembly of deities.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Imagine the essential 
      nature of all the substances to be burned in the process of pacification 
      as undefiled ambrosia of primordial wisdom [270] in the&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 184 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">form of those 
      substances, which are offered to the mouths [of the deities]. As a result, 
      the minds of the entire assembly of deities are satisfied with the taste 
      of bliss and emptiness. Then white-colored rays of light emanate from 
      their bodies, completely clearing away all diseases, demons, vices, 
      obscurations, karmas, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities of 
      your own mind-stream and those of the beings you are visualizing, like the 
      sun shining upon frost. Repeatedly imagine them being totally purified, 
      without even a trace being left behind. That is the visualization for 
      pacification. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">For increase, 
      visualize the entire assembly of radiant deities, invite all the jinas and 
      jinaputras of the three times in the form of your special deity, and 
      imagine them dissolving [into that assembly]. Imagine the essential nature 
      of all the substances to be burned as immeasurable, undefiled ambrosia of 
      the primordial wisdom of bliss and emptiness in the form of each of those 
      substances. Offering them to the mouths of the assembly of deities, their 
      minds are satisfied with the taste of bliss and emptiness; and all their 
      majesty, power, and ability expand greatly. Blazing rays of light are 
      emanated, drawing in the compassion, blessings, empowerments, siddhis, 
      primordial wisdoms, and qualities of the entire assembly of the jinas, 
      bodhisattva,&nbsp; gurus, chosen deities, Dharma Protectors, gods of wealth, 
      and treasure-masters, without exception; and they draw in all the life, 
      merit, radiance, power, and ability of all gods and demons, the eight 
      classes of lhamasin, and all the sentient beings of the three realms of 
      the universe. [271] Having dissolved into yourself and the visualized 
      [deity], repeatedly imagine that your life, merit, wealth, empowerments, 
      siddhis, power, and ability all greatly increase and grow. Imagine that 
      all the empowerments, blessings, and siddhis of the deity generated in 
      front of you also dissolve into yourself in the form of a yellow mass of 
      light, such that your vitality, merit, wealth, power, and creative 
      abilities are increased and stabilized.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">For power, all the 
      substances to be burnt are displayed in the form of each of those 
      substances, and their essential nature is bliss and emptiness, the vital 
      essence of the ambrosia of undefiled, primordial wisdom. The mere sight of 
      this brings fulfillment, the mere touch of it brings satisfaction, and the 
      mere experience of it has the ability to liberate. By offering that to the 
      mouths of the primordial wisdom deities, their minds are intoxicated by 
      the taste of the primordial wisdom of bliss and emptiness; the radiance, 
      majesty, power, and enormous might of their bodies blazes up, withdrawing 
      in the form of rays of red light all the power, empowerments, and siddhis 
      of the jinas and jinaputras of the ten directions and the four times, as 
      well as all the guardians of the doctrine, Dharma protectors, gods of 
      wealth, and treasure-masters. Dissolving into yourself, imagine that you 
      possess the power of mastery over both samsara and nirvana. [272] 
      Moreover, all the compassion, blessings, and siddhis of the deity 
      generated in front of you dissolve into yourself in the form of rays of 
      red light. From your heart and the heart of the deity generated in front 
      of you immeasurable rays of red light are emanated in forms like hooks 
      and&nbsp; nooses. All the enjoyments, wealth, and bedding of the gods, demons, 
      and humans of the three realms and the three worlds, of male and female 
      beings, and of the eight classes of lhamasin, yaksas, gods of wealth, and 
      treasure-masters are&nbsp; inexorably brought under your control and placed in 
      front of you. Consequently, faced with the majesty and unbearably glorious 
      luster of your own body and that of the deity generated in front of you, 
      they agree to be your servants and to work on your behalf; and they swear 
      to be your slaves forever. As a sign of their oath, vajras appear on the 
      crowns of their heads. Having received the vitality of their solemn 
      pledge, imagine that an unceasing flow of a torrential rain of all manner 
      of enjoyments descends upon your dwelling. With&nbsp;</font></p>

      ferocity the substances to be burnt are visualized as being of the 
      essential nature of the combined flesh, blood, life force, life, and 
      vitality of your enemies and malevolent beings. [273] They are forcefully 
      summoned and inserted [in the drub kung]; and when they are finally 
      scooped up with the ritual ladle, all the life force, life, physical form, 
      vitality, and breath of those enemies is taken with the ladle, like fruit 
      scooped up by the handful. Then repeatedly imagine the clear, pale soles 
      of their feet dissolving into the mouths of the visualized deities in the 
      midst of the fire, like a pebble thrown into a pond. Even in the case of a 
      murdered person, you imagine his body and consciousness indivisibly 
      dissolving into the mouth of your chosen deity; and as you count the 
      number of scoops and offer them into the fire, by visualizing this 
      intently, that person will certainly not take birth among demons or 
      malevolent spirits. By engaging in the pacificatory visualizations with 
      respect to others, know that the mind of the dead person is drawn into the 
      absolute nature of your chosen deity. By repeatedly performing burnt 
      offerings in those ways, you have the advantage of accomplishing the four 
      types of enlightened activities; and those are taught as conventional 
      reality. </font></p>

      of the ambrosia of the primordial wisdom of bliss and emptiness. That is

      nature of the immutable body-vajra, and manifesting the fully maturated 
      state of a vidyadhara. All the secret empowerments, blessings, and siddhis 
      of the speech as a mass of red light marked by ah dissolve through your 
      throat into your voice, blessing your voice as the unceasing speech-vajra, 
      and manifesting the state of a vidyadhara with mastery over life. All the

      Once again, five- colored rays of light, like a mass of rainbows, from the 
      five places [of the deities in front of you] dissolve into your own five 
      places, utterly purifying your two obscurations and all habitual 
      propensities, and blessing you with all the inexhaustible, circles of 
      ornaments of their bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and enlightened 
      activities, and manifesting the state of a spontaneous vidyadhara. In 
      short, the meditation of imagining that you have achieved all the supreme

      of the stage of generation are features of the dharmakaya, the awareness 
      that is present as the ground. Taking a metaphor for each one, they are 
      taught simply in terms of the field of experience of the mind caught up in 
      activities and agents. Know that they have no reality apart from that. 
      Until now, under the influence of ignorance, [276] the qualities of the 
      ground have been reduced to something ethically neutral, which is of no 
      benefit or harm. If you know how they are perfect in this way, that 
      perfection is made manifest, so that is an unsurpassed feature that 
      distinguishes the vehicle of the Great Perfection. By recognizing the 
      method aspect of the stage of generation in the absolute nature of wisdom, 
      [one knows that] the tantra of the union of the related wisdom and method 
      is none other than this.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the method of 
      transferring one's impure body, speech, and mind into the realm of the

      space, the great mystery of all the jinas, the absolute nature free of all 
      extremes of conceptual elaboration, in which ultimately there is no body. 
      By practicing in accordance with that reality, they are finally liberated 
      into the realm of its essential nature. One's own body is instantaneously 
      [transformed] into red Vajrayogini, with a blazing curved vajra-blade in 
      her right hand subjugating all the three realms, and her left hand holding 
      a marked skull cup displaying the three realms as ambrosia of the 
      enlightened body, speech, and mind. With her legs in an advancing posture, 
      she is a youthful maiden of sixteen years, her body beautifully adorned 
      with the signs and symbols of enlightenment. [277] The braids of her hair 
      are adorned with five kinds of precious substances and are beautified with 
      a diadem, and her head is wreathed with various flowers. With a slightly 
      peaceful arid slightly ferocious countenance, her body is visualized as

      midst of a blazing mass of rainbow fire. Its essential nature is empty and 
      primordially not established as anything; but to forcefully counteract the 
      delusion of clinging to it as a material composite, its emptiness is 
      presented not as inside; rather, emptiness is imagined as the limpidity of 
      the body. Imagining its limpidity inside in the center, as a means to 
      subdue the vital energy and mind in emptiness, her hollow body is 
      visualized as a pavilion of light. In its center is a hollow channel, a 
      tube of light, which is white on the outside, symbolizing bliss, red on 
      the inside, symbolizing clarity, and indigo blue in between, symbolizing 
      emptiness. Its interior is empty and unobstructed, symbolizing the Spirit 
      of Awakening; it is as long as a medium arrow shaft, and its surface has 
      no width at all. Its upper end at the cakra of great bliss at the crown of 
      the head is suddenly open, and its lower end below the navel is firmly 
      closed like a joint in a bamboo. Its characteristics are that it is as 
      straight as the trunk of a plantain tree, [278] as thin as a lotus petal, 
      as clear as a&nbsp; sesame oil lamp, and as shiny as the sap from a teak tree. 
      As a sheer emptiness, it abides in the essential nature of the dharmakaya.

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">On its right is the 
      red roma channel, red on the outside and white on the inside. On its left 
      is the white kyangma channel, white on the outside and red on the inside. 
      The lower ends of both of them are inserted inside the central channel 
      below the navel. Visualize their upper ends curving around the back of the 
      ears and opening out through both nostrils. Know that those three 
      symbolize the three embodiments. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The so-called five 
      stacked cakras in that central channel have secondary channels: in the 
      first cakra distinctly visualize thirty-two secondary channels, in the 
      second, sixteen secondary channels, in the third, eight secondary 
      channels, in the fourth, sixty-four, and in the fifth, twenty-eight 
      secondary channels.50</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">However, ultimately 
      the whole of samsara and nirvana is pervaded by the center of emptiness; 
      the roma represents the primordial wisdom of its clear nature; and the 
      kyangma stands for the great primordial wisdom of omnipresent 
      compassion.51 All the aggregates, elements, and sense- bases are 
      emptiness, which is primordially not established and non-local. The 
      placement of emptiness in the center is taught as a basis for 
      purification, but it is certainly not established. [279] The three 
      embodiments are revealed as the three channels as great emptiness, which 
      is primordially self-arisen. The nine yanas are revealed as remedies to 
      purify the obscurations of ignorance, karma, and mental afflictions in the 
      absolute nature. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Accordingly, by 
      recognizing the karmic energies as being of the nature of karma, the 
      mental afflictions, and habitual propensities, the residual energies are 
      cleared out by means of the nine-fold expulsion. Imagine that all the 
      karma, mental afflictions, vices, obscurations, and habitual propensities 
      aroused by the affliction of hatred are expelled in the form of 
      smoke-colored air and disappear into space. Clear those out three times 
      through the right nostril. Imagine that all the karma, mental afflictions, 
      vices, obscurations, and habitual propensities aroused by the affliction 
      of attachment are expelled in the form of dark red air, and clear them out 
      three times through the left nostril. Imagine that all the karma, mental 
      afflictions, vices, obscurations, and habitual propensities aroused by the 
      affliction of delusion are expelled in the form of dark blue air and 
      disappear into space like a rainbow. Clear those out three times through 
      both nostrils equally. Imagine that all illnesses, demons, vices, 
      obscurations, and habitual propensities, together with the material 
      aggregate of flesh and blood, disappear into space in the form of minute 
      particles, like beating out a soiled cloth. [280] Imagine that in the 
      domain of the channels, vital energies, and </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>

      that delude one in the endless cycle of existence, together with their 
      seeds and habitual propensities, are expelled as fragments of blackness 
      and disappear into space. Recognize this purification of the body as the 
      sublime, quintessential means for clearing out evils and malevolent 
      beings. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then, in terms of the 
      vital energy of meditative equipoise and the vital energy of 
      post-meditation, ultimately the absolute nature of wisdom is apprehended 
      in the state of the great clear light, the awareness of primordial wisdom 
      of all the jinas. Leaving your body, speech, and mind in a state of 
      inactivity is the unsurpassed, supreme technique for inserting the vital 
      energy and mind into the central channel. In that technique, with your 
      physical posture imbued with the seven attributes of Vairocana, in the 
      space at the level of the tip of your nose imagine the synthesized 
      essential nature of all empowerments, blessings, and siddhis of the 
      bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and enlightened activities of all the 
      jinas and jinaputras of the ten directions and the four times in the form 
      of light blue air, like a covering of mist. Imagine that from your 
      nostrils the vital energy of blessings and primordial wisdom is drawn in 
      like a blue, silken thread or the wafting smoke of incense. [281] Imagine 
      that they swirl totally into the lower end of the central channel by way 
      of the roma and kyangma channels; and in the central channel, like an 
      inflated placenta, all the channel-knots come completely loose. Imagine 
      that the nutriment of the vital energies dissolves into the five secondary 
      channels, and the residues swirl into the lower end of the central 
      channel. During each session, three times rotate your torso and press 
      down, uninterruptedly drawing up a continuous stream of the gentle energy, 
      and hold that as long as you can. That is the vital energy of meditative 
      equipoise. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Alternatively, inside 
      the central channel at the level of your heart visualize a smooth, round 
      bindu of five lights, and in its center imagine a clear,</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 192 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">shimmering, white 
      syllable a, pale like a full moon. In the lower end of the central channel 
      imagine the energies of the five primordial wisdoms in the form of a vajra-swastika. 
      As in the previous case, imagine that the nutriment of the energies 
      dissolves into the syllable a and the bindu; while the residue dissolves 
      into the variegated vajra, which is the basis of the energies. By&nbsp; 
      sustaining that visualization, the energies will be inserted into the 
      central channel, and the energies of the primordial wisdoms will rest in 
      their own place.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In post-meditation as 
      well, ultimately, you do not leave the domain of your own awareness, 
      without delusion with respect to appearances or the mind. Those who lack 
      such a crucial point should continually press down their vital energies 
      below the navel, without ever forgetting this, including during such 
      activities as eating, sleeping, walking, and sitting. [282] That is the 
      vital energy of the post-meditative state, and it is especially profound 
      to achieve stability in that. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately, the 
      primordial wisdom of knowing reality as it is makes manifest the center 
      that is present as the ground; and the primordial wisdom that sees the 
      full range of phenomena extinguishes the karmic energies in their own 
      place and establishes the energy of primordial wisdom in its place. The 
      flaming up of tummo, the great, inactive, empty awareness, the fire of 
      primordial wisdom, the union of bliss and emptiness, which blazes as a 
      creative expression of the power of the five primordial wisdoms, pleases 
      the mandala of self-appearing, primordial wisdom. Once all the deluded 
      karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities of ignorance are 
      naturally purified, you achieve in yourself the great depths of the 
      primordially pure dharmakaya.&nbsp; That is the ultimate tummo.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Conventionally, 
      visualize the essential nature of the vajra of the skillful means of great 
      bliss in the form of the syllable ham at the upper end of the central 
      channel of emptiness. At the lower end visualize the essential nature of&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 193 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">the wisdom of great 
      emptiness in the form of a cone. That is struck by the essential nature of 
      the primordial wisdom of discernment, which is a creative expression of 
      awareness, in the form of the energy of the primordial wisdom of 
      blessings. Consequently, the tummo tongue of flame of primordial wisdom 
      bears four characteristics: it is red in color, of the essential nature of 
      bliss, of the nature of clarity, and hot to the touch. Its tip is of the 
      nature of wisdom, visualized as sharp and darting. [283] As it flickers 
      many times, you slowly inhale, there is a fullness at the navel, a 
      churning in the stomach, and the residue is shot up like an arrow. Due to 
      those four applications, the tongue of fire blazes in the navel cakra and 
      suffuses it, incinerating all karma, mental afflictions, and habitual 
      propensities so that none remain. The tongue of flame grows and totally 
      engulfs the cakra of the wheel of dharma at the heart, incinerating all 
      karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities so that none remain. 
      Growing upwards, it totally suffuses the cakra of the wheel of enjoyment 
      at the throat, burning to a singe all karma, mental afflictions, and 
      habitual propensities. Still increasing in size, it totally fills and 
      suffuses the entire cakra of great bliss at the crown of the head, burning 
      to a singe all karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities. 
      Flaming up again, it strikes the syllable ham at the crown, increasing the 
      sense of the primordial wisdom of bliss and emptiness in which skillful 
      means and wisdom meet. The ambrosia of the primordial wisdom of bliss and 
      emptiness from the bindu descends in a continuous stream, filling and 
      suffusing all the secondary channels of the cakra of great bliss, and 
      making immeasurable offerings pleasing to the body mandala of the buddha 
      sugatas. [284] Their minds are satisfied with the taste of bliss and 
      emptiness, the two accumulations are completed, and the two obscurations 
      are purified. Then imagine that you receive the vase empowerment of the 
      body and the great primordial wisdom of delight arises in your 
      mind-stream.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      taste of bliss and emptiness, the accumulations are completed, the

      descends to your genital region, pervading all the secondary channels of

      that the undefiled bliss of the ambrosia of bliss and emptiness is 
      generated, [285] the tummo fire of primordial wisdom is conjoined with 
      great warmth, the blessing energy of primordial wisdom generates power,

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again the ambrosia of

      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again imagine that the 
      nature of the blessing energy of primordial wisdom, the tummo fire of 
      primordial wisdom, and the ambrosia of the primordial wisdom of bliss and 
      emptiness grows and bursts into flame, completely filling all the channels 
      and elements of the body. Then all obstacles, demons, malevolent beings, 
      compulsive ideation, and habitual propensities [286] are incinerated, like 
      tiny insects consumed in the fire at the end of the eon. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again the central 
      channel together with the fire grows larger, such that the entire animate 
      and inanimate cosmos with its three realms are inserted inside the central 
      channel, and all concepts of grasping onto the animate and inanimate 
      cosmos and all karma and mental afflictions are burnt to a singe. Imagine 
      that they all become of the nature of emptiness. The entire central 
      channel together with all the fire remain as they were previously, and 
      while focusing your consciousness on them, count many full breaths of air.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Alternatively, with 
      yourself as Vajrayogini, visualize a red cone at your navel, together with 
      a bindu and nada, and an upside down, white syllable ham at the crown of 
      your head. In the space at the level of the tip of your nose, draw in, 
      like a silken thread, the mist-like, blue, blessing energies of primordial 
      wisdom through both nostrils. Passing through the paths of the roma and 
      kyangma, they unify at the lower end of the central channel. Agitating the 
      bindu in the cone, the tongue of flame of wisdom-gnosis blazes up, 
      incinerating all karma, mental&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">afflictions, and 
      habitual propensities; all knots in the channels are loosened by the vital 
      energies, so that they dissolve naturally. Imagine that the fire fills the 
      cakras, and your entire body is suffused with great warmth. All great, 
      [287] medium, and small channels are filled with the fire-energy, and in 
      the entire network of channels within the body a white bindu rests on top 
      of each knot, and a red bindu rests below each one, so that they merge 
      indivisibly. All qualities of experience and realization are more and more 
      enhanced. The entire interior of the central channel is suffused with the 
      tongue of fire, and a continuous stream of the ambrosia of the undefiled, 
      primordial wisdom of bliss and emptiness of the melted bindu of the ham 
      syllable strikes the cone. Imagine that as a result, the fire and ambrosia 
      blaze nondually, such that the primordial wisdom of the four delights of 
      bliss and emptiness suddenly arises in your mind-stream and becomes 
      immutably stable. Retain many counts of the breath in accordance with the 
      duration of your meditation session.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At all times and in 
      all situations do not forget the growth of the tummo tongue of flame of 
      primordial wisdom in the central channel and all the cakras, and focus 
      your consciousness on pressing it down. That is the crucial point for the 
      post-meditative state, and that, too, will cause the warmth of bliss to 
      blaze mightily. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Some people take this 
      as the foundation and train in space yoga. This is done as follows. 
      Noisily sucking in the three times, such that everything, right down to 
      the last bit of space, [288] is drawn into your mouth, imagine that your 
      entire belly is filled with a blueness; and the full extent of space is 
      pervaded by your abdomen. Imagine that all of space is enclosed inside 
      your abdomen, space and your vital energies and mind indivisibly, 
      spaciously, and gently relax; and remain in meditative equipoise as long 
      as you can.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 197 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again suck in all air, 
      imagining it in the aspect of the color green, such that all air moving 
      through space, together with its nutriment and vital essence, completely 
      fills your abdomen. Again, with a sucking sound, imagine that all water in 
      the aspect of the color white are inhaled inside you, such that water, 
      together with its vital essence and power, completely fills your belly. 
      Again imagine all the earth of the three realms in the aspect of the color 
      yellow being inhaled with a sucking sound, leaving not even a trace of a 
      remainder, and totally filling your abdomen. Again sucking in all fire in 
      the aspect of red light, and the nutriment and vital essence of fire of 
      the cosmos, together with the warmth of bliss, completely fills your 
      belly. Placing fire and your mind-itself in the state of nondual 
      pervasiveness is the sublime path of the yoga of the display of vital 
      essence of the elements.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In reality, the 
      central channel is emptiness; [289] the fire and vital energy are reality 
      as it is and the full range of phenomena; the syllable ham is the skillful 
      means of great bliss; the cone is the essential nature of the wisdom of 
      emptiness; the cakras are the five kinds of primordial wisdom; the five 
      aggregates are the five sugatas; the five elements are the five consorts; 
      the eight faculties are the eight male bodhisattvas; the eight objects are 
      the eight female bodhisattvas; the four extremes of substantialism and 
      nihilism are the four gate-keepers; all assemblies of thoughts are the 
      spontaneously present assemblies of noble viras and yoginis of the 
      absolute nature which vanishes into emptiness. Thus, the support is the 
      channels; that which moves is the vital energies; and the display is the 
      essential nature called bodhicitta. They are perfected as natural 
      expressions of reality-itself, the sugatagarbha, so that is called the 
      Great Perfection of the four modes of existence. Accurately knowing the 
      manner in which they are perfected is called the Great Perfection of the 
      path of reality-itself. By establishing with discerning wisdom the 
      ethically neutral state of the Great Perfection that is present as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">ground, one accurately 
      knows the nature of existence. Consequently, one progresses all at once 
      through the grounds and paths, and just that is the genuine Great 
      Perfection of the definite completion of the path.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In that way, due to 
      the qualities of training with the channels, bindus, and vital energies, 
      [290] the siddhi of the fruitional Great Perfection becomes manifest; and 
      one achieves mastery over the eight common siddhis. Moreover, The Tantra 
      of the purificatory Yoga of the Channels, Vital Energies, and Bindus is 
      none other than this.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At that point, 
      Bodhisattva Vidyavajra made this vast prayer: </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">&quot;O excellent, 
      excellent, Bhagavan! <br>
      The empty vajra pierces jewels. <br>
      Empty Rahula conquers the sun and moon. <br>
      Empty tongues of flame burn up kindling. <br>
      The empty movement of the air disperses material things. <br>
      Empty space conquers the animate and inanimate cosmos. <br>
      Empty reality-itself conquers phenomena. <br>
      The buddhas conquer the maras. <br>
      The Sangha conquers false views. <br>
      May the view of emptiness be realized <br>
      With the precious truth of emptiness. <br>
      May the meaning of the Great Perfection be realized <br>
      With the precious view of emptiness. <br>
      By the power of the Great Perfection <br>
      May the cycle of existence be dredged from its depths.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 199 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then he continued, &quot;O 
      Teacher, Bhagavan, thus, even if one correctly knows the nature of being 
      of the Great Perfection of Ssamsara and nirvana, the great expanse&nbsp; which 
      totally subsumes the inexhaustible ornamental wheel of the bodies, speech, 
      minds, qualities, and enlightened activities of the jinas and jinaputras 
      of the three times, [291] the great quintessence of all the dakinis and 
      viras, in what is that synthesized, what does it boil down to, and what 
      are its names? May the Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, first simply determining the mode of existence of the ground 
      as discussed previously, then ascertaining emptiness is the 
      ground-emptiness, the great middle way. Therefore, the knowledge that all 
      the embodiments, primordial wisdoms, buddha-fields, and displays, and all 
      of samsara, nirvana, and the paths are not other than the nature of the 
      ground itself is called the Great Perfection of samsara and nirvana. To 
      sentient beings who have not gained liberation within themselves, the 
      ground appears as the nature of samsara, and clinging to it, they become 
      deluded. By turning away from the delusion of mental engagement with 
      self-concepts and signs and establishing the ground by means of 
      analytical, great wisdom, one comes to know the characteristics of the 
      ground as they are. Profoundly fathoming all the avenues of the path and 
      fruition and of skillful means and wisdom as the nature of the ground 
      itself is the synthesis [292] of the pristine space of the ground. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">What does it boil down 
      to? However the various reflections of planets and stars may appear in the 
      ocean, they are not other than the ocean itself, so they can be boiled 
      down to the ocean. All appearances of the animate and inanimate cosmos and 
      sensory objects are not other than space itself, so they can be boiled 
      down to space. Likewise, know the way in which all of samsara, nirvana, 
      and the paths are not other than the nature of the space of the absolute&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 200 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">nature of reality, for 
      they can be boiled down to the pristine space of the absolute nature of 
      reality. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">How is it to be named? 
      The entire array of names in the realms of samsara and nirvana are 
      ascertained as names of the sugatagarbha. In particular, the names of all 
      the Dharmas that cause the path to become manifest are applied to this. 
      Since it is the unsurpassed transference and entrance to the manifestation 
      of the fruition--the state of the precious Spirit of Awakening--it is 
      called the Spirit of Awakening. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">All authentic 
      realities are included in the precious Spirit of Awakening, so it is 
      reality; and just as the ocean is ascertained as the source of all rivers 
      and streams, that is ascertained as the ultimate source of all Dharmas, so 
      it is ultimate. Just that is free of all flaws and taints, so it is 
      purified; and [293] since all of samsara, nirvana, the path, and fruition 
      are perfected in the absolute nature of reality, it is perfected. All the 
      phenomena of samsara and nirvana are established by means of discerning 
      wisdom, and the wisdom of realizing identitylessness is made manifest. 
      Pervasive, all-seeing, great wisdom manifests the nature of existence, its 
      inner depths are reached within oneself, and by retaining one's own place 
      of rest, the cycle of existence of the three realms is dredged from its 
      depths. Not regarding this as being like dream appearances disappearing 
      into the absolute nature, or like the fabrications of an illusion 
      dissolving into the absolute nature, by the might of the great mind, the 
      cycle of existence of the three realms is liberated as displays of the 
      three embodiments. So that is called spirit.52</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">These teachings, far 
      more secret than any mystery, are of the nature of the synthesis of the 
      mystery of the minds of all the jinas, so they are called secret. As for 
      the way to practice the path to the nature of existence of this very
