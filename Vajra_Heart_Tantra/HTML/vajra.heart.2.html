      of all the jinas of the three times are of one taste in the absolute 
      nature of reality, there is the Mind Lineage of the jinas. Because the 
      symbolic signs of the space treasury of reality-itself are spontaneously 
      released without reliance upon the stages of spiritual training and 
      practice, there is the Symbolic Lineage of the Vidyadharas. Because the 
      practical instructions naturally arise as an oral lineage and an entrance 
      to the disciples' path, [5] in the manner of filling a vase, revealed by 
      themselves, not by human beings, as an apparitional display of primordial

      reality in which these three are unified as the spiritual mentor of the 
      world, bless me with the circle of ornaments of the inexhaustible three 
      mysteries of the jinas and jinaputras. The myriad of the oath-bound three

      the obscuration of self-concepts and grasping onto duality, individuals 
      are bound by clinging onto the true existence of the deceptive cycle of

      of those fortunate ones who are empowered with respect to the 
      space-treasury of reality-itself, I shall present this king of tantras, a 
      fundamental tantra that has naturally arisen from the nature of being of 
      the sugatagarbha. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Here is the way this 
      tantra first arose. On the evening of the fifteenth day of the first lunar 
      month of the Male Water Dog Year, due to the power of the profound, swift 
      path of the Leap-over, the direct vision of reality-itself appeared; and 
      as a result of a little practice of the path of the method of the stage of 
      generation, [7] I reached the ground of a fully matured vidyadhara. By the 
      power of arriving there, all appearances and mental states dissolved into 
      primordially pure reality- itself, the absolute nature free of conceptual 
      elaboration. Then the very face of the dharmakaya became manifest. After 
      some time, spontaneous appearances arose like this in the form of a buddha-field: 
      on that very occasion of self-arisen, primordially pure, great bliss, my 
      environment was the naturally appearing, real Akanista. This apparitional 
      buddha-field was vast and spacious, with its surface smooth and level, and 
      pliant to the touch. Grassy mountains of medicinal herbs were fragrant 
      with mists of fine aromas. The whole ground was completely covered with 
      various radiant, luminous, clear, sparkling, shimmering, lovely flowers in 
      shades of white, yellow, red, green, blue, and multiple hues. In the four 
      directions were four oceans of ambrosia imbued with eight excellent 
      qualities. [8] On the shores of those great oceans were pebbles of jewels, 
      sand of gold, turquoise meadows, and overarching halos of rainbows. 
      Forests of wish-fulfilling trees flourished in the four cardinal 
      directions, emanating billowing clouds of sensory offerings. Various types 
      of beautiful, emanated birds sang forth the sounds of Dharma with gentle, 
      soothing calls. Various lovely, emanated animals frolicked about and 
      appeared to be&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 3 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">contentedly listening 
      to the Dharma. The whole sky was covered with checkered patterns of 
      lattices of rainbow light. Everywhere the sky was filled with singing and 
      dancing viras and viras, and many goddesses made sensory offerings and 
      devotions.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In the center of that 
      region, in a great, delightful garden, resting against a tree covered with 
      foliage and flowers, there was a vast and lofty jeweled throne supported 
      by eight lions. The branches of the tree were draped with various silk 
      hangings, and full and half-garlands of jewels, and many tinkling 
      peppercorn bells gave rise to the natural sounds of the holy Dharma. Upon 
      that lion-throne was a lotus, [9] sun, and moon seat, upon which was the 
      true Teacher Samantabhadra Saroruhavajra, naturally appearing with the 
      radiance of the ground of reality. His body was blue-black in color, 
      bearing the features of an eight-year-old youth. His right hand displayed 
      the mudra of expounding the Dharma, and his left hand was in the mudra of 
      meditative equipoise. He was adorned with the signs and symbols of 
      Awakening and all the apparel of a sambhogakaya.&nbsp; Within the realm of his 
      ocean-like, limpid, transparent body, naturally appeared all the peaceful 
      and wrathful jinas and myriads of buddha fields and emanations, like 
      bright reflections of planets and stars in a lake. Incalculable rays of 
      blazing light emanated from him, and from their tips appeared various 
      symbolic letters. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Gathered around the 
      Teacher were natural displays of the entire assembly of his apparitional 
      retinue of 84,000 disciples, including Bodhisattva Vidyavajra, Bodhisattva 
      Prajnendra, Bodhisattva Jnanavajra, Bodhisattva Mahasahasrananta, 
      Bodhisattva Prasannatindra, Bodhisattva Anabhogavyuha, Bodhisattva 
      Parabhasa Vasavartin, Bodhisattva Aksendriya, Bodhisattva Srotendriya, 
      Bodhisattva Ghranendriya, [10] Bodhisattva Jihvendriya, and Bodhisattva 
      Kayendriya. They all were gazing at the face of the Teacher, and</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">they remained silent 
      as they reverently bowed. The Teacher remained silent as he looked into 
      the realm of space. At that time, these natural sounds of reality itself 
      emerged from the realm of pristine space:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ah. The whole of 
      samsara and nirvana is groundless and rootless.<br>
      The Vajra Queen is great space.<br>
      The great emptiness of space is the Great Mother.<br>
      All phenomena are apparitions<br>
      Of reality-itself and the sole nature.<br>
      Everything is born from the unborn.<br>
      The emergence of arising apparitions ceases.<br>
      Causes and conditions are extinguished right where they are.<br>
      Thus, the Teacher and the Teaching, the path and its fruits,<br>
      In reality-itself are devoid of signs and words.<br>
      The many avenues of method and wisdom<br>
      Appear as the great, natural event and natural arising.<br>
      The space of no-object and great openness<br>
      Is limpid, clear, and free of contamination.<br>
      All displays of the buddha-field, Teacher, and retinue<br>
      Are nonexistent, but from nonexistence they appear as existent.<br>
      That we praise with great wonder! [11]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As soon as those 
      sounds occurred, the entire assembled retinue said to the Bhagavan with 
      one voice, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, Pervasive Lord, and Immutable Sovereign, 
      please listen and heed our words! May the Teacher explain why this entire 
      buddha-field, the Teacher, and the assembled disciples are here and tells 
      us whence this all arose.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 5</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Teacher replied, 
      &quot;O apparitional disciples, listen! Why have these apparitions of 
      primordial wisdom--the buddha-field, Teacher, and disciples arisen? They 
      are for the sake of revealing an entrance to the nonconceptual primordial 
      wisdom of the minds of all the sugatas of the three times in accordance 
      with the faculties of all sentient beings who are wandering in the cycle 
      of existence of the three realms. The vision of the naturally appearing, 
      real Akanista as a buddha-field will reveal the great vision of 
      reality-itself by the great power of wisdom and primordial wisdom. I am 
      the primordial ground, the Teacher who naturally appears from the innate 
      luster of the sugatagarbha, appearing to myself. The innate luster of 
      empty awareness, free of conceptual elaboration, appears as Vidyavajra. 
      The innate luster of the wisdom of identitylessness appears as Prajnendra. 
      The innate luster of the eight collections of consciousness, together with 
      the mental factors, [12] appears as the assembled retinue.&quot;</font></p>

      <p align="left"><u><font face color="#000066" size="4">
      <a name="The Questions of Prajnendra">The Questions of Prajnendra</a></font></u></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Prajnendra rose from his seat and asked the Bhagavan, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, 
      if you appear as the innate luster of the sugatagarbha, if I, Prajnendra, 
      appear as the innate luster of wisdom, if Vidyavajra appears as the innate 
      luster of awareness, and if the assembly of male and female bodhisattvas 
      appears from the eight collections of consciousness, together with the 
      mental factors, we should appear in that way to all the sentient beings of 
      the three realms. However, in the midst of delusive appearances of joys 
      and sorrows, friends and enemies, they continue in the three realms of 
      existence, where miseries occur and pure appearances do not. Why is that? 
      May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of 
      good breeding, sentient beings who have been reduced to the ethically 
      neutral ground do not see pure appearances. Impure, delusive mental states 
      and appearances concerning friends and enemies and joys and sorrows are 
      characteristic of ordinary sentient beings. Here inconceivable pure 
      appearances arise due to the great power of wisdom and primordial wisdom 
      to individuals who have previously sat in the presence of the non-human, 
      naturally appearing Teacher, the perfect Buddha, and [13] Orgyen 
      Padmavajra. Those people attained the supreme siddhi after entering the 
      gateway of Vajrayana Dharma and applying themselves diligently to its 
      practice. Then, until the myriads of realms of sentient beings are empty, 
      they bring forth the power of pure prayers, as a result of which they 
      repeatedly arise as Teachers for the sake of the world, teaching in 
      accordance with the individual needs of disciples. Due to the stimulation 
      of their previous karmic momentum, they directly see the truth of reality- 
      itself, and they emerge from the realm of wisdom. To them these pure 
      appearances arise, but they are not minds and&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 7</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">mental factors. 
      Rather, these appearances are by nature creative displays of manifest, 
      absolute reality. They are not the eight collections of consciousness, but 
      they are not anything else; so they are called by those names. They appear 
      in numerous ways from the nondual Teacher and retinue. Those known as 
      bodhisattvas have gone well beyond mundane existence, even though they 
      have not become buddhas; and so they are known.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Bodhisattva 
      Prajnendra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, so it is. Thus, if the 
      apparitional Teacher and the entire retinue are nondual and not different, 
      there is no point to all the teaching and listening on the part of the 
      Teacher and the assembly of disciples. [14] There is no difference in the 
      quality of everyone's primordial wisdom, so what point is there in putting 
      on the show of teaching and listening? May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Prajnendra, in the past the naturally appearing Teacher of disciples known 
      as Sakyamuni, a Teacher like the sun, arose as an emanation like sunlight. 
      The Teacher, those who requested [the Dharma], and the retinue acting as 
      listeners appeared to be teaching and listening to individual sorts of 
      spiritual paths and vehicles for training disciples. Although the Teacher 
      and the retinue were nondual, for the sake of the disciples, various 
      expressions of skillful means were displayed, like an illusionist and his 
      illusion.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 8</font></p>
      <p align="left"><u><font face color="#000066" size="4">
      <a name="The Questions of Mahasahasrananta">The Questions of 
      Mahasahasrananta</a></font></u></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Mahasahasrananta reverently bowed to the Bhagavan, and with his palms 
      pressed together he requested, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, so that all sentient 
      beings may be liberated from the ocean of miseries of mundane existence 
      and reach the state of liberation, please grant us profound, practical 
      instructions for manifestly achieving the state of the fully perfected 
      Buddha Samantabhadra in one life and with one body.&quot; [15]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Teacher replied, 
      &quot;O all you assembled disciples, including Mahasahasrananta, listen! The 
      great, sublime path that brings all sentient beings to the grounds and 
      paths of liberation is called the swift path of the clear light Great 
      Perfection. This is the most sublime of all Dharmas, a general synthesis 
      of all paths, the destination of all spiritual vehicles, and an expansive 
      treasury of all secret mantras. However, the only people who will 
      encounter this path will be those who have stored vast collections of 
      merit in many ways over incalculable eons, who have repeatedly made 
      extensive prayers for the state of perfect Awakening, and who have 
      previously sought the path and established habitual propensities for it in 
      order to reach the path by means of other vehicles. No one else will do 
      so. Why? Under the influence of negative deeds and due to the strength of 
      powerful, devious maras of mental afflictions, even if unfortunate people 
      are present where this vehicle is being explained and heard, their minds 
      will be in a wilderness five hundred yojanas away. [16] Those unfortunate 
      servants of mara, with their perverse aspirations, act contrary to this 
      profound Dharma and respond to it with abuse, false conjecture, 
      repudiation, jealousy, and so on. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">On the other hand, 
      those who enter this gateway and implement the meaning [of these 
      teachings] will never be more common than the appearance</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 9</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">of a star during the 
      daytime. Upon entering [this path], some will dispense with it after 
      acquiring mere understanding and learning, and they will go astray with no 
      sense of conscientiousness. Not engaging in spiritual practice, they will 
      face death as ordinary beings, and they will not achieve liberation. In 
      general, to enter this vehicle and put it into practice, one must have all 
      the following characteristics:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">belief in the Dharma 
        and one's spiritual mentor</font></li>
        <li>
        <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">trust in the path 
        without uncertainty</font></li>
        <li>
        <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">earnest mindfulness 
        of death and recognition of composite phenomena as being impermanent, 
        thus having little attraction to mundane activities</font></li>
        <li>
        <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">contentment with 
        respect to food, wealth, and enjoyments</font></li>
        <li>
        <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">insatiability 
        towards Dharma due to great zeal and determination</font></li>
        <li>
        <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">unifying one's life 
        and spiritual practice without complaining</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If people with mental 
      stability who are not boastful about the mere number of months and years 
      they have spent practicing in retreat see this entrance and practice, they 
      will undoubtedly achieve the supreme state of the Jina Vajradhara in this 
      very lifetime. [17] It is said of other vehicles that after accumulating 
      [merit and knowledge] and purifying obscurations for three countless eons, 
      one finally, manifestly becomes perfectly enlightened. However, under the 
      influence of karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities over 
      many eons, while one continues through many lifetimes, one is influenced 
      by various types of thoughts and deeds, making it difficult to meet with 
      the path of accumulation and purification. Think carefully about this 
      situation, and you will come to a clear certainty.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Be that as it may, at 
      the present time, due to excellent karmic connections from the past, you 
      have obtained a sublime human life with leisure and</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">opportunity, and you 
      have encountered the most sublime of Dharmas, the Secret Mantra Vajrayana. 
      This is no time for ultimately holding onto the hope of accumulating 
      [merit and knowledge] for a long time and then finally attaining 
      Awakening. Rather, you must apprehend the ground of your own being for 
      yourself by experiencing the self-nature of the sugatagarbha, the 
      primordial ground that is the path to liberation in this life. Apart from 
      that, the teachings concerning the possibility of achieving the state of 
      liberation as a result of accumulating much karma from one life to another 
      are effective for bringing about temporary happiness in the minds of 
      sentient beings; but buddhahood by that means is extremely difficult.&nbsp; 
      Consider that those teachings may have merely a provisional meaning.&quot; [18]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Bodhisattva 
      Mahasahasrananta commented, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, in this present human 
      life one may strive for good, mind-expanding attitudes and for bodily and 
      verbal virtues. Then by practicing at some time in the future the view and 
      meditation of the clear light Great Perfection, the vajra essence of the 
      Secret Mantra, one might possibly achieve liberation. But it is said that 
      it is difficult to achieve liberation merely by practicing in this life. 
      Moreover, it is said that small minded beings, such as sravakas and 
      pratyekabuddhas, cannot fathom the deep and vast Vajrayana Dharma. Is that 
      true or not? If it is true, while there may be differences in quality and 
      capacity in the minds of sentient beings, if it were necessary to 
      transform into a being of the Mahayana class, the small-minded would have 
      to become greater, and there would have to be those whose minds are so 
      immense that they cannot expand. If that were so, one would have to 
      acquire some Secret Mantra from somewhere other than one's own 
      mind-stream. In that case, I don't know what that would mean. May the 
      Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 11</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Mahasahasrananta, if you think like that, if you have arrived at the 
      gateway of the Secret Mantra in this present lifetime, you have firm faith 
      of belief in that, [19] and you have strong, unflagging enthusiasm, the 
      time has come to practice. When fortunate people encounter the gateway of 
      the profound Secret Mantra, apart from simply achieving firm faith of 
      belief, they will never have any other clairvoyance, omens, or auspicious 
      circumstances to make them think that now the time has come to practice 
      Secret Mantra. Once you have obtained a human life and encountered the 
      Secret Mantra Dharma and a spiritual mentor, if that is not the time to 
      practice the Great Perfection, there will certainly be no other auspicious 
      circumstance than that in any other lifetime. It is not that sravakas, 
      pratyekabuddhas, ordinary beings and so forth are too small- minded. 
      Rather, due to their previous karma, they do not encounter the gateway of 
      the Secret Mantra. Or even if they do, they have no faith and no belief, 
      and as a result of spiritual sloth and distraction, they do not practice.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Know that this has 
      nothing to do with the specific capacities of people's minds. Do not think 
      that there are differences in the capacities of the minds of all sentient 
      beings. To those fettered by selfishness, I teach that by opening their 
      hearts to all sentient beings throughout space, without concern for their 
      own self-interest, [20] they will see the reality of the nonduality of 
      self and other.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Mahasahasrananta

      them to expand their minds by meditating on the profound mystery of the 
      Great Perfection?&nbsp; Or, even if they meditate on the Great Perfection, must 
      they bring forth the Spirit of Awakening by some other means? May the 
      Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">whole of samsara and 
      nirvana is called the ultimate Spirit of Awakening of the ground. Just 
      that is to be apprehended. Apart from that, the so-called Spirit of 
      Awakening that is strenuously fabricated with the intellect is a 
      mind-state in which one views oneself as the meditator and other sentient 
      beings as objects of meditation. That attitude is as confined as a 
      teacup.&nbsp; In the realm of the Great Perfection, the original nature of the 
      great equality of samsara and nirvana, the mode of existence of the 
      ground-itself is known just as it is by means of great, all- knowing, 
      primordial wisdom of omniscience. To speak of having a Spirit of Awakening 
      greater than the vision of great, all-seeing primordial wisdom would be 
      like having water and yet saying you must seek liquid elsewhere. [21] The 
      original, primordially pure ground, the great reality that pervades the 
      whole of samsara and nirvana, is the Spirit of Awakening. Without that 
      knowledge, just the kind sense of compassion and love of parents for their 
      children is an objectifying, conceptual state of mind. With that alone, 
      one might aspire for fortunate rebirth, but hoping that this will lead to 
      buddhahood is as senseless as hoping that the son of a barren woman might 
      become a householder.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Bodhisattva 
      Mahasahasrananta requested, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, may the Teacher reveal 
      the profound path that liberates disciples!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of 
      good breeding, there appear to be many avenues of skillful means and 
      wisdom that serve as entrances to the city of great liberation. But 
      ultimately taking the mind as the path is the quest for the true path; and 
      once the ground has been determined, one may take reality-itself as the 
      path. Between those two alternatives, first of all here is the way to take 
      the mind as the path. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At the outset, 
      disciples who maintain their samayas initially train their<br>
      minds by way of the common, outer preliminaries, namely the Four Thoughts</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 13</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">that Turn the Mind, 
      and the uncommon, seven inner preliminaries. [22] At the conclusion of 
      those, here is the way to engage in the stages of the main practice of 
      seeking the path.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">First of all go to a 
      totally secluded forest, offer prayers of supplication to your spiritual 
      mentor, merge your mind with that of your mentor, then relax for a little 
      while. O Mahasahasrananta, among your body, speech, and mind, which is 
      most important? Who is the agent? Tell me, who is that unchanging, 
      autonomous sovereign? Then to the great benefit of disciples, the acts of 
      teaching, listening, and the nature of the instruction will become 
      perfectly clear.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Mahasahasrananta responded, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, the body is constructed 
      by the mind. When matter and awareness separate following death, the mind 
      follows after one's karma, then it again deludedly grasps onto the 
      appearance of a body. Moreover, one's body in the waking state, one's body 
      while dreaming, and one's bodies following this life are all constructed 
      by the mind of self-grasping. They are temporary transformations that have 
      never existed except as mere appearances to the mind. Therefore, as the 
      mind is the all-performing sovereign, it is of the utmost importance.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">A mindless body is 
      nothing more than a corpse, so it has no power. When the body and mind 
      separate, the phenomena of feeling joy and sorrow, reaching the state of 
      buddhahood or wandering about in the three realms of samsara [23] are due 
      to the mental consciousness becoming deluded with respect to objects. So 
      that is certainly the agent. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for speech, 
      whatever appearances of vocalization arise, they are nothing more than 
      appearances to the mind. Speech has no existence other than the phenomena 
      of vocalization constructed by the mind's conceptualization, so the mind 
      is most important. When the body, speech, and mind are separated&nbsp; </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 14</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">one by one, the mind 
      continues on; the body turns into a corpse; and the speech vanishes 
      altogether; so the mind is definitely the most important.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This is the way the 
      body, speech, and mind are established as being non-different. In the 
      practice of the stage of generation, one's own body, speech, and mind are 
      regarded as displays of the vajra body, speech, and mind of one's chosen 
      deity.&nbsp; By so doing, they are purified, and liberation is achieved. If 
      they were separate, both the immutable vajra of the body and the unimpeded 
      vajra of the speech would be left behind when the mind is drawn elsewhere. 
      Then when the assembly of the three vajras disintegrated, would the deity 
      not perish? Therefore, they are not different, so the many are ascertained 
      to be of one taste. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Thus, those three are 
      none other than the mind; they are ascertained to be the mind alone; and 
      that is the best and highest understanding.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again the Teacher 
      asked, &quot;Do you, the all-performing sovereign, have form or do you not? If 
      you do, what type of living being's form do you resemble? [24] Does that 
      sovereign have eyes, ears, a nose, a tongue, and mental cognition or not? 
      If so, where do they exist these days? Where are they? Moreover, do you 
      have a round, rectangular, semicircular, triangular, many-side, or some 
      other kind of shape? Are you white, yellow, red, green, or variegated in 
      color or not? If you are, by all means let me see this directly with my 
      eyes or let me touch it with my hand! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you are certain 
      that none of those exist, you may have fallen to the extreme of nihilism. 
      Therefore, now disclose to me the reality of samsara and nirvana,&nbsp; joy and 
      sorrow, appearances and the mind, and all their substantial causes.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Mahasahasrananta 
      responded, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, the self has no form, so it is empty of 
      form. Likewise, it has no sound, smell, taste, touch, or</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 15</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">mental objects, so it 
      is empty of each of those. It is empty of shape and color, so it is empty. 
      The eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and mental cognition all certainly have no 
      existence apart from limpid, clear consciousness itself. Without 
      nihilistically reducing them to nonexistence, the indeterminate 
      manifestations of samsara and nirvana appear to be like an illusionist 
      [25] and his illusions. Thus, I have come to the conclusion that [the 
      mind] is simply an unceasing agent.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Bhagavan asked, &quot;O 
      Mind Vajra, tell me, what is the source from which you first originated? 
      Did you originate from earth, from water and fire, from air and space, or 
      did you originate from the four cardinal directions, the eight directions, 
      from above or from below? Investigate the place of origination and that 
      which is originated, and analyze them! Likewise, investigate the location 
      in which you subsequently are present and that which is present, and 
      analyze them!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If this so-called mind 
      were located in the head, when the foot is pierced by a thorn, for 
      instance, there would be no reason for experiencing a sharp pain. If it 
      were located in the feet, why would there be discomfort even if the head 
      and other limbs were amputated? Suppose it were located in the body as a 
      whole. In that case, if unbearable regret and misery arose in the mind 
      when an external piece of clothing, a cup, a house, and other possessions 
      were taken away by others or destroyed and so on, the mind would have to 
      be located in those. If it were located inside, there would be no one who 
      identifies with things outside. If it were located outside, there would be 
      no clinging or grasping onto the body inside. If it is true that it is 
      located in the body nowadays, where will it be located when it is 
      separated from the body? [26] On what will it depend?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Directly point out the 
      body, face, and location of the one who is present. Investigate the 
      location and the environment of the one who is present, and the size and 
      so forth of the agent. Observe! Finally you must investigate the act of</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">going and the agent 
      who goes, so observe the destination, the path, and the point of departure 
      on the part of the mind, the all-performing agent, and watch how it moves. 
      If you see the act of going and the one who goes, show me the size of the 
      goer and its form, shape, and color.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Mahasahasrananta 
      responded, 'O Teacher, Bhagavan, I have no eyes, and due to their absence, 
      there is nothing that appears as form. Likewise, I have no ears, and due 
      to their absence, there is nothing that appears as sound. I have no nose, 
      and due to its absence, there is nothing that appears as smell. I have no 
      tongue, and due to its absence, there is nothing that appears as taste. I 
      have no body, and due to its absence, there is nothing that appears as 
      touch either. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Therefore, the five 
      senses as well as their appearances do not exist, so there is no one who 
      is originated. If the one who is originated is not established, from this 
      time onwards the so-called mind is not established and nonexistent. Until 
      now there should have been something bearing attributes called this 
      entity. I am unoriginated emptiness, so the source of origination is 
      empty. As to seeking the place of origination, earth is something I have 
      constructed. [27] Similarly, all phenomena including water, fire, air, and 
      space are nothing other than apparitions of self- grasping alone. So the 
      one who is originated is ascertained to be nonobjectifiable.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">I am non-local 
      emptiness, so there is nowhere I am present. As for the so- called body, 
      sores, swelling, goiters, ulcers, and so on may arise in the body that 
      appears in the waking state, but they are not present in the dream-body. 
      Although sores, swelling, goiters, and ulcers may appear to have beset the 
      body and limbs in a dream, they are not present as phenomena in the waking 
      state. As phenomena in the waking state, the body may be wounded or beaten 
      as a king's punishment, but that does not appear on the dream-body. If 
      that happens in a dream, it is not present on the body in the waking 
      state. Similarly, location,</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">environment, and the 
      agent that appear to be outside or are grasped as being inside are all 
      nothing more than apparitions of myself alone.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Therefore, I am not 
      present in either external or internal phenomena. External and internal 
      phenomena are not present in me. They are apparitions of self-grasping, 
      like an illusionist and his illusions. They are not constructed 
      intentionally as in the case of an illusionist and his illusions. The self 
      arises, so the appearances of others just arise automatically, but they 
      have no location. One may investigate the destination and the agent, but 
      the locus of movement and the destination are all nonobjectifiable; so 
      they do not apply to the nature of me and mine. All phenomena appear while 
      being nothing other than the domain of the self. [28] Moreover, that is 
      the way the body, speech and mind have never existed separately, and their 
      appearances are of the same taste. In all waking appearances, dream 
      appearances, and appearances after this life, the body, speech, and mind 
      are not different from me. Thus, it is certain that the agent of going and 
      the destination are not established.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Bhagavan replied, 
      &quot;O Mind Vajra, investigate the dimensions of your so-called mind, then 
      establish and recognize its essential nature. Are both external space and 
      the internal mind the same or different? If they are the same, the 
      essential nature of the mind must be space. If they are different, you 
      would have to agree that space in a dream, space in the daytime, and space 
      after this life are not one but different. If the previous space ceases 
      and the subsequent spaces occur one after the other, each space would be 
      subject to transformation, creation, and destruction. In that case, 
      ascertain the causes and conditions from which they arise. If space 
      manifestly appears in the daytime due to the sun rising in the morning, 
      doesn't the sun cause it to appear in a dream and after this life? Or is 
      it the clear light of your own mind? Don't merely give this lip-service; 
      rather, penetrate this with certainty.&quot; [29]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 18</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Mahasahasrananta 
      responded, &quot;OTeacher, Bhagavan, space is indubitably ascertained to be the 
      essential nature of my mind. During the daytime, earth, water, fire, air, 
      the self, others, form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mental objects are 
      displayed in the domain of space; and the mind holds them by means of 
      conceptualization. In dream appearances as well, the ground of the mind 
      appears as space, and the entire world, its inhabitants and sense objects 
      are all displayed as they were before.&nbsp; In future lives, too, the 
      essential nature of the mind appears as space, and in that domain the 
      entire world, its inhabitants and sense objects appear in the same manner; 
      they are held by the mind, and one is deluded again and again. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Therefore, space, the 
      self, others, and all sense objects are of one taste, and they are 
      certainly not different. Moreover, it is the vividness of space itself, 
      and nothing else, that makes appearances become manifest. The essential 
      nature of the mind and the ground is space itself. Various appearances 
      occur in the realm of mental cognition--limpid, clear, forever-present 
      consciousness. The display of those appearances is like the reflections in 
      a mirror or the images of planets and stars in a pool of limpid, clear 
      water. Once limpid, clear consciousness has entered into the central 
      domain of pervasive, empty space, it is directed inwards. [30] At that 
      time, the mind and all appearances disappear and expand infinitely into 
      ethically neutral, pervasive emptiness. I have ascertained that due to 
      self-grasping, great, pervasive emptiness, the essential nature of the 
      ground, arises as the mind and mental factors. The space and vividness are 
      none other than the reality of the limpid, clear mind-itself, which, as a 
      result of conditions, falls into self and other. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Taking&nbsp; just the mind 
      as the path, a person of superior faculties directly experiences the 
      nature of being of thatness, which is reality-itself, realizes the 
      comprehensive view of samsara and nirvana, and achieves liberation in the

      space. A person of middling faculties attains conviction in the formless 
      realm, and a person of inferior faculties experiences joy in the form 
      realm. For a person of the lowest faculties, the path is experienced as 
      happiness in the desire realm. May the Teacher explain how this is so!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O Mind 
      Vajra, first of all, merge this mind with external space, and remain in 
      meditative equipoise for seven days. Then fix your attention on a stone, a 
      stick, a physical representation of the Buddha, or a letter, and remain in 
      meditative equipoise for seven days. Then imagine a clear, radiant, 
      five-colored bindu at your heart, fix your attention on it, [31] and 
      remain in meditative equipoise for seven days. As a result, for some 
      people the mind remains blissful, brilliant, and vacuous. That experience, 
      devoid of any thoughts, is like an ocean unmoved by waves, and that is 
      called quiescence imbued with signs. Some cannot inhibit thoughts because 
      the mind is so agitated, and they experience uncomfortable illness and 
      pain in the heart, the vital channel, and so on. Those with unstable 
      minds, with a wind-metabolism, or with unrefined minds may possibly fall 
      into unconsciousness or into a trance. In that case, relax and let 
      thoughts be as they are; and continually observe them with unforgetting 
      mindfulness and revealing introspection. Stillness without thinking of 
      anything is called stillness in the domain of the essential nature. The 
      fluctuation and appearance of various thoughts is called fluctuation. Not 
      letting any thoughts remain unconscious, but knowing them by means of 
      mindfulness and introspection is called awareness. With that explanation, 
      recognize them. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">'Now in order to 
      remain for a long time in the domain of the essential nature, observe 
      motion, keep your body straight, maintain vigilant mindfulness, and

      do not cease, nor do you get lost in them as usual; [32] rather, they are

      By striving unceasingly at all times, both during and between meditation 
      sessions, finally all gross and subtle thoughts will be calmed in the 
      empty domain of the essential nature. You will remain and become 
      stabilized in an unfluctuating state, in which you will experience joy 
      like the warmth of a fire, clarity like the dawn, and nonconceptuality 
      like an ocean unmoved by waves. Craving this and believing in it, you will 
      not be able to bear being separated from it, and you will cling to it. If 
      you get caught up in joy, this will cast you into the desire realm; if you 
      get caught up in clarity, this will cast you into the form realm; and if 
      you get caught up in nonconceptuality, this will cast you to the peak of 
      mundane existence. Therefore, know that while these are indispensable 
      signs of progress for individuals entering the path, it is a mistake to 
      get caught up in them forever.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">That is called 
      ordinary quiescence of the path, and if you achieve stability there for a 
      long time, you will have achieved the critical feature of stabilization in 
      your mind-stream. However, know that among unrefined people in this 
      corrupt era, very few appear to achieve more than fleeting stability. In 
      these times, the chosen deities of some people appear to them, and they 
      settle their attention on the deity. To some, visions of buddha-fields 
      appear, and they stabilize and settle their minds on them. Some especially 
      experience joy, clarity, or nonconceptuality , [33] and they settle there. 
      To some, images of their spiritual mentor, rainbows, light, and bindus 
      appear, so they settle on those, and so forth. Know that due to the 
      functioning of the channels and elements of each individual, there is no 
      uniformity in their experiences.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Mahasahasrananta 
      asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, please explain how meditative experiences and 
      realizations arise as a result of such practice.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">&nbsp;He replied, &quot;O Mind 
      Vajra, in all the tantras, oral transmissions, and<br>
      practical instructions of the past, awareness is nakedly revealed. Among 
      them, I</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">shall not teach more 
      than a mere fraction of the ways signs of experience occur. Due to the 
      unimaginable complexity of individual metabolisms and faculties, there is 
      a correspondingly unimaginable array of experiences. Thus, as I am aware 
      that there is no uniformity, know that I shall speak only in the most 
      general terms.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The indeterminate, 
      unimaginable variety of avenues of experience are inexpressible; but 
      teachers endowed with great experience, who are proficient in accounts of 
      the grounds and paths, and possess extrasensory perception are 
      knowledgeable and lucid due to the power of their great wisdom. On the 
      other hand, vidyadharas [34] up to the stages of full maturity and mastery 
      over their life span may be unfamiliar with the ways in which experiences 
      occur, and yet they know them directly by means of extrasensory 
      perception. Even if they do not, they can free others from [mundane] 
      experience by modifying the instructions and interpreting them [for each 
      individual].</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As an analogy, devas, 
      risis, brahmins, acaryas, and so on, who are practicing samadhi, may 
      cultivate samadhi by bringing some seed-syllables to mind. As a result, 
      for whatever task those syllables were used in meditation, later they can 
      accomplish those tasks by reciting those syllables; and on whatever 
      illness they focus, later on men and women can be benefited by reciting 
      those syllables for that illness. Likewise, vidyadharas can intuitively 
      identify all illnesses, or, by revealing techniques of meditation and 
      recitation for that purpose, they can dispel all but a few illnesses that 
      are incurable due to past karma. That being the case, it goes without 
      saying that they can elevate contemplatives' experiences onto the path.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If foolish teachers 
      lacking any of those qualities give instruction to students and say that 
      all [the above] experiences will arise in the mind-stream of a single 
      individual, they are deceiving both themselves and others; and they are</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 22</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">reduced to being maras 
      to the lives of their students. Why? Unpredictable outer phenomena of 
      apparitions of gods and demons, inner phenomena of various physical 
      illnesses, and secret phenomena of experiences such as mental joy and 
      sorrow may possibly occur. [35] In their instructions on the mind, 
      foolish, stupid teachers explain the causes that give rise to such 
      experiences, and when the experiences occur, they fail to recognize them 
      and instead take them to be illnesses. They compound that by mistaking 
      them for demons, they think anxieties indicate death, and they insist that 
      their students must resort to divinations, astrology, and medical 
      treatment. Then due to seeing the faces of demons and malevolent beings, 
      the students may apply themselves to various rituals and techniques. But 
      whatever they do, it is only detrimental, and it does not benefit them in 
      the slightest, and finally they can only die. Thus, as if he had given 
      them a deadly poison, the teacher becomes a mara for his students. Ponder 
      this point carefully, and be skillful! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Now meditation is 
      introduced by way of terms such as insight, so there are many explanations 
      of the stages of the path. Here on our own path mindfulness is presented 
      as being like a cowherd, and thoughts as being like cows. Their steady, 
      vivid manifestation, without interruption by the various appearances of 
      hope and fear and joy and sorrow is called enmeshed mindfulness. In 
      general, these are some of the signs of progress for individuals who are 
      taking appearances and awareness as the path: [36] You may have the 
      impression that all your conceptual activity is wreaking havoc in your 
      body, speech, and mind, like boulders rolling down a steep mountain, 
      crushing and destroying everything in their path. You may feel a great 
      pain in your heart as a result of all your thoughts, as if you had been 
      pierced with the tip of a weapon. You may have the ecstatic, blissful 
      sense that mental stillness is a joy, but movement is a pain. You may have 
      a vision of all phenomena as brilliant colored particles. You </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 23</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">may experience 
      intolerable pain throughout your body from the tips of the hair on your 
      head to the tips of your toenails. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Or you may have the 
      sense that even food and drink are harmful, for you are tormented by 
      various afflictions included among the 404 types of identifiable, complex 
      disorders of wind, bile, and phlegm, and so on. You may have 
      unidentifiable afflictions due to paranoia about meeting other people, 
      visiting their homes, or being in town; and you compulsively look with 
      hope to medical treatment, divinations, and astrology. You may experience 
      such unbearable agony that you think your heart will burst. Sleep does not 
      come at night, [37] and even if it does, like someone who is critically 
      ill, you do not remain asleep. When you wake up, your mind is filled with 
      grief and you are miserable, like a camel that has lost its beloved calf. 
      Convinced that there is still some decisive understanding or knowledge you 
      must have, you yearn for it just as a thirsty person longs for water. All 
      kinds of thoughts stemming from the mental afflictions of the five poisons 
      arise one after the other, and you must unbearably follow after them. You 
      may have any manner of experiences of speech impediments and respiratory 
      ailments. All thoughts, which are expressions of the mind, and all 
      appearances of joys and sorrows are experienced as such, so they are 
      called experiences; and they cannot be articulated. All appearances of 
      joys and sorrows are simultaneously forgotten and vanish. You think there 
      is some special meaning for yourself in every external sound that is heard 
      and form that is seen. Thinking that there is something to be learned from 
      the signs and omens that are present in everything you see and feel,&nbsp; 
      including the chirping of birds, you engage in compulsive speculation. Or 
      all external sounds and voices, including those of humans, dogs, and 
      birds, may seem like thorns piercing your heart. [38] Unbearable anger 
      arises due to the paranoid sense that everyone else is slandering you and 
      speaking against you. You may react&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">negatively when 
      hearing and seeing others joking around and laughing, and with the sense 
      that they are making fun of you, you may verbally retaliate. Due to the 
      experience of your own suffering, when observing others, you compulsively 
      long for their happiness. With your mind filled with a constant stream of 
      anxieties, fear and terror arise toward weapons and even your friends; so 
      all phenomena give rise to every kind of hope and anxiety.&nbsp; In this phase, 
      when you get into bed at night, you may see visions of other people who 
      will come the next day; and when you observe visions of their faces, 
      forms, minds, conversations, and demons and so forth, fear, anger, and the 
      obsessive attachment and hatred uncontrollably arise, and you cannot fall 
      asleep.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Some people shed many 
      tears due to their reverence and devotion to their spiritual mentors, 
      their faith and devotion in the [Three] Jewels, their sense of 
      renunciation and disillusionment with the cycle of existence, and their 
      powerful compassion for sentient beings. Some people may find that all 
      their suffering vanishes, and their minds are filled with limpidity and 
      delight, like pristine space. [39] Rough experiences may precede such 
      limpidity. You may have the sense that gods or demons are actually 
      carrying away your head, limbs, and vital organs, leaving behind only a 
      trail of vapor; or you may merely have the sensation of this happening, or 
      it may occur in a dream. Afterwards, all your mental suffering vanishes, 
      and you experience a sense of ecstasy like the sky free of clouds. In the 
      midst of this, four mindfulnesses and various kinds of pleasant and harsh 
      sensations may occur. Spiritual friends who teach this path properly must 
      know and realize that those are not the same for everyone, so bear this in 
      mind! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">For one with a 
      fire-metabolism, a sense of joy is prominent; for one with an 
      earth-metabolism, a sense of obscuration is prominent; for one with a 
      water metabolism, a sense of clarity is prominent; for one with a wind- 
      metabolism,</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 25<br>
      <br>
      harsh sensations are prominent; and for one with a space-metabolism, a 
      sense of emptiness is prominent. After all pleasant and harsh sensations 
      disappeared into the absolute nature, there is no need to modify thoughts. 
      Rather, by letting them be as they are, everything that arises loses its 
      capacity to help or harm, and you dwell in that state. You may also have 
      an exceptional sense of joy, clarity, and nonconceptuality, [40] visions 
      of gods and demons, and a small degree of extrasensory perception. The 
      channels and elements function differently from one person to the next, so 
      those with dominant earth and wind elements commonly do not experience 
      extrasensory perception or visionary experiences. Extrasensory perception 
      and visions happen chiefly to fire-element and water-element people.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Now here are the 
      different levels classified by name: superior vision with single-pointed 
      mindfulness, in which movement and mindfulness are unified, is called 
      insight. At this time if the sense of stillness predominates, that is 
      called the union of quiescence and insight. In what way is that vision 
      superior? Previously, even if you watched with great diligence, you were 
      obscured by subconscious movement and by laxity and dullness; so thoughts 
      were hard to see. But now, even without exerting yourself very much, all 
      thoughts that arise become conscious, and you see them exceedingly well. 
      As for the experiential visions at this stage, to some contemplatives, 
      wherever they look, everything that arises appears as divine embodiments 
      and as vibrant bindus. To some, a variety of different seed-syllables, 
      various lights, and all manner of forms appear. To some appear buddha-fields, 
      unknown regions, melodies, songs, and speech by various unknown beings, 
      [41] and indeterminate varieties of many viras and dakinis dancing and 
      displaying various expressions. To some, all sights, sounds, smells, 
      tastes, and tactile sensations appear as all manner of signs and omens. 
      Some have the sense of observing many entities with and without form by 
      means of extrasensory perception.</font></p>
