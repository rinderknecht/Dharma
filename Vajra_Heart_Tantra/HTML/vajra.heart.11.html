      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Dharma, emptiness goes 
      awry, and there is no remedy for that. Thus, it is crucial for you to know 
      that. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In summary, at all 
      times and in all situations let your behavior be calm, subdued, and 
      conscientious, and continually guard your pledges and vows. [329] Avoid 
      sinful, nonvirtuous deeds as if they were poison. With no other virtue to 
      practice, apply yourself assiduously to the profound view and meditation, 
      striving in this essential practice for your whole life. By constraining 
      your mind as if you had come into the presence of the premier of judges, 
      recognize the importance of restraint. Until you reach the state of the 
      extinction into reality-itself, you must correctly avoid the bad and adopt 
      the good in terms of actions and their consequences. Until you attain the 
      four types of fearless confidence that are indications of having attained 
      liberation, suffering will result from nonvirtue, and joy will result from 
      virtue. This can be known by investigating and carefully reflecting upon 
      the nature of the cycle of existence and delusion as you have been 
      constantly addicted to experiencing the cycle of delusive experiences 
      during beginningless lifetimes right up to the present. Even though you 
      have an ocean of knowledge acquired from hearing, if you have no practice 
      of profound meditation, you are like a person who returns empty-handed 
      from an island of jewels, and you will die as an ordinary person and 
      continue wandering in the cycle of existence. Therefore, with diligent 
      meditation apply yourself to the essential practice. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Thus, when you are 
      engaging in practice, whether an unprecedented, soothing sense of bliss 
      arises, or a pristine sense of clarity , or a nebulous nonconceptuality, 
      if you take this to be genuine meditation and cling to it as the 
      fulfillment of your hopes, or if you regard those as areas of danger and 
      block them, or if you alter them with you mind, such practice entailing 
      hopes and fears will lead you astray. In contrast, once you have 
      recognized the nature of&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 228 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">existence of 
      meditative experiences, by letting them be in their own state, without 
      attachment, craving, rejection, or affirmation, they will vanish 
      altogether, like mist disappearing into the sky, and the primordial wisdom 
      of awareness will become manifest. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">You may perceive 
      various disagreeable forms of gods and demons,&nbsp; different kinds of 
      pleasant and unpleasant sounds, various foul odors, disagreeable tastes, 
      various kinds of tactile sensation:;, and you may have nightmares and wake 
      up at times in a panic. Those experiences may bring forth different types 
      of distress in your heart and mind. Due to your diet, environment, or 
      trauma, illnesses may arise, and merely as a result of coming into contact 
      with soil, rocks, wood, or weapons, you may come down with afflictions 
      difficult to heal. Various bad omens, such as sores, leprosy, or ulcers, 
      may occur as apparitions created by gods or demons, which arise from 
      external sources. Any of the four hundred and four classes of illnesses of 
      wind, bile, phlegm and combinations of them may arise, and--as if the 
      entire might and strength of your mind had seeped away into 
      them--inexpressible suffering may occur .Those are called physical 
      illnesses, which arise from within. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">With respect to 
      objects of the mind, you may experience happiness, attachment, hatred, 
      craving, unbearable suffering, delight, clinging to the experience of 
      emptiness and luminosity, a sense of sheer vacuity in which appearances 
      and the mind cease, paranoia that everything you see or feel is out to 
      harm you, or the pride of thinking, 'There is no contemplative on earth 
      who has a view and meditation like mine.' Under the influence of anger and 
      malice, you may disturb the minds of others, and afterwards feel remorse. 
      You may feel that everything you have done is wonderful, and consequently 
      feel free to do whatever you like. Such indeterminate experiences of joy 
      and sorrow are called joys and sorrows due to the mysterious impulses in 
      the mind. Know that&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 229 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">all such sensations 
      are deceptive experiences that occur as signs along the path; [332] and, 
      without attachment, craving, rejection, affirmation, hope, fear, or 
      modification, leave them as they are. By so doing, they will release 
      themselves. Hold this knowledge to be of the highest importance. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If your meditative 
      experience leads to illness and you compound this by interpreting this as 
      being due to demonic influence, no matter how much you devote yourself to 
      magic rituals for dispelling obstacles, or to medical treatment, that will 
      only harm you, without bringing any benefit. However much you try, you 
      will not get even the slightest bit of benefit. Eventually, if the sentry 
      of identifying the meditative experience is lost, you will go insane, pass 
      out, faint, or become as ignorant as an animal, or this might lead to your 
      own death. In the past there have been many faithful students who kept 
      their pledges and vows, and there have always been spiritual mentors who 
      became siddhas, so they knew the various dispositions and faculties of 
      specific students; and they led them to the state of the Jina Vajradhara 
      in one lifetime and with one body. Even when they are not led astray by 
      anyone, nowadays students invariably fail to keep their pledges, they have 
      little faith or reverence, and they are barbaric and prone to false views. 
      Blind teachers hanker after meditative experiences and give teachings and 
      make their students meditate so that they objectify and cling onto views 
      and meditation. [333] Consequently, instead of identifying the occurrences 
      of mere pleasure and pain and comfort and distress as meditative 
      experiences, due to their ignorance of the differences between experiences 
      that arise from external and internal sources, they say they are due to 
      demonic influences, thus misleading their own students. Such illegitimate 
      teachers are certain to become maras for their students. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Due to specific 
      dispositions and faculties, experiences may arise solely from external 
      sources without any internal source; they may arise solely from&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 230 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">internal sources and 
      from no external or mysterious sources; or they may arise solely from 
      mysterious sources and from no external or internal source. Thus, it is 
      especially crucial that you must know how to distinguish among those. 
      Nowadays, during this degenerate era, when the teachings of the Buddha 
      have fallen into decline, some teachers say to sustain awareness on the 
      movements [of the mind], and since even they have no experience or 
      realization from that, the lives of all such teachers and their disciples 
      are vainly spent doing that, and they die as ordinary people. That has 
      happened many times. Some teachers remain absorbed in a relaxed, gentle 
      state of joy and tell others this is the culmination of the view and 
      meditation; and they get stuck there. Other teachers experience a sense of 
      luminosity, seeing gods and demons, [334] and becoming absorbed in a 
      steady vividness of the mind and appearances, they teach that to others. 
      Some become absorbed in a pristine, nonconceptual sense of emptiness, in 
      which there is no memory or appearances, and they teach that to others. 
      Others become absorbed in an unceasing, unstructured state of 
      consciousness, and teach this to others as the best view and meditation. 
      Those who identify the view and meditation in those ways do not rise above 
      the three realms, for they have not realized the view of emptiness. They 
      are imprisoned by that failing, and consequently they do not see the 
      grounds or paths of liberation and omniscience. Some people idle away 
      their whole lives by being addicted to ragged books and oral explanations, 
      so when death suddenly comes upon them, they lack even the slightest 
      confidence of fearlessness. Those who become fixated solely on hearing and 
      teaching take pride in their affluence and status in this life. As for 
      those who become entranced for their whole lives by delusive appearances 
      and mental states and those who become captivated by the knowledge gained 
      from hearing and by teaching, there is no qualitative difference in the 
      objects of their craving, just as there is no difference between</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 231 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">being bound by gold 
      fetters and rope fetters. Everything that you cling to acts solely as a 
      cause for the bondage of your own mind-stream.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">First you should come 
      to know the critical points and narratives concerning the vast view and 
      meditation. Finally, you should sincerely dedicate yourself to essential 
      practice, [335] and you will reach the state of liberation without getting 
      caught up in pitfalls and errors. In that way, hearing strikes the core. 
      Otherwise, if your pride and sense of self-importance increase due to 
      hearing and understanding through hearing teachings many times, everything 
      you see will become an object for false views and invalid denials and 
      superimpositions; not even the slightest faith or reverence will arise in 
      your mind-stream; and you will be filled with the pomposity of thinking, 
      'There's not a single person like me!' With contempt for others, you will 
      abuse them, and upon hearing or witnessing other renowned people teaching, 
      the power of fierce pride will arise, and out of a sense of jealousy, you 
      will superimpose faults that are not present and deny excellent qualities 
      that are present. For such people, learning turns into poison, and the 
      foundation is laid for rebirth in a miserable state of existence. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Therefore, from the 
      very beginning scrutinize such teachers and avoid them. Do not depend upon 
      them! Regard as a buddha any spiritual mentor from whom you have received 
      as little as a single verse of instruction, and do nothing to displease 
      him even for an instant. If you do displease your spiritual mentor, you 
      are abandoning all the buddhas of the three times, so no meditative 
      experiences, realizations, or excellent qualities will arise in your 
      mind-stream. Even if merit is accumulated, its fruits will not arise. Even 
      if you engage in practices involving deities and their mandalas, {336] you 
      will actualize nothing but demons and spirits who cause you to break your 
      pledges. The seeds of liberation will dry up and will not bear fruit. The 
      trunk of omniscience will rot&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 232 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">and its leaves will 
      not grow. Once you have received empowerment and three lines of guidance, 
      even from a non-Buddhist Samkhya, revere him as the foremost of spiritual 
      mentors and never withdraw your reverence. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">When you are sitting, 
      you may take refuge in the [Three] Jewels by imagining your spiritual 
      mentor on the crown of your head. When you are walking, visualize your 
      mentor on your right shoulder and imagine you are circumambulating him. 
      That is far superior to circumambulating all the jinas of the three times. 
      When you are partaking of food and drink, visualize your mentor at your 
      throat, and eat your food, imagining it to be ambrosia. Thus, whatever you 
      eat will become a ganacakra offering and a fire offering. When you are 
      meditating and when you are lying down, visualize your mentor at your 
      heart, and by merging your mind with his, you will experience the 
      nonconceptual primordial wisdom of reality-itself; and extraordinary 
      realizations will arise in your mind-stream. When you are practicing, if 
      you imagine [yourself] as being of the nature of the deity and protector, 
      you will not falsely reify the stage of generation, and a myriad of 
      supreme and common siddhis and enlightened activities will arise. 
      Likewise, if you depend upon a sublime spiritual mentor without violating 
      [this relationship], that is the supreme gist of spiritual conduct.&quot;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Bodhisattva Vidyavajra 
      then commented, [337] &quot;If all the paths and fruitions were originally, 
      primordially, completely present in awareness, all sentient beings would 
      certainly have come to the view of the Great Perfection. So what is the 
      difference [between buddhas and sentient beings]? May the Teacher 
      explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, it is not as you say. There is no difference between all the 
      buddhas and all sentient beings other than that the former are&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 233 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">aware and the latter 
      are not. Thus, all sentient beings apprehend their own appearances as 
      being other than themselves and thus become deluded. All the buddhas 
      perceive the pure equality of samsara and nirvana, and thus became 
      Awakened. Therefore, awareness is the great, original, primordially pure 
      ground, and it recognizes samsara and nirvana as displays of pure equality 
      .The reality-itself of awareness to which that character manifests is 
      inconceivable primordial wisdom.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Bodhisattva Vidyavajra 
      then commented, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, if one takes the primordial wisdom 
      of awareness as the path, how is liberation attained? What advantages are 
      there in that?&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, once you have gained mastery over the primordial wisdom of 
      awareness, if you meditate uninterruptedly, you will attain liberation in 
      this life and with this body, and you will become a buddha. If one person 
      who had accumulated much karma from the five deeds of immediate 
      retribution [338] and another person who had practiced the stage of 
      generation for his whole life were both to identify awareness 
      simultaneously and meditate upon it--since the mind-itself is not 
      contaminated by faults or virtues--one would not become enlightened even

      of awareness simultaneously and practice that--since awareness is 
      liberated in itself, without reference to activities--there would not be 
      the slightest difference in their attainment of enlightenment. That is a

      contributing conditions--one would not become enlightened even an instant

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If one person who had 
      dedicated his whole life to constructing temples and stupas and to 
      protecting the lives of others and another who had devoted his entire life 
      to being a butcher, taking the lives of others, were both to identify the 
      ground-awareness, the great freedom from extremes, and persistently apply 
      themselves to practicing that, there would not be even the slightest 
      difference in their attainment of enlightenment. That is a solemn promise 
      of myself, Samantabhadra. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The point of all that 
      is that all delusive activities, like actions in a dream, are never 
      performed, but due to clinging to the true existence of the mere 
      appearances of activities, that which does not exist is seen to exist. 
      Since those actions neither help nor harm the ground-awareness, the great 
      freedom from extremes, [341] they make no difference with respect to 
      attaining enlightenment. There is no object that is benefited by good 
      deeds, so, like space, they do not exist as something good. There is no 
      object that is harmed by bad conduct, so they are of the nature of 
      space--objectless, intangible, and all-pervasive. The reason for their 
      appearing to exist in this way is that, due to ignorance of the ground, 
      which is your own mode of existence, you wander endlessly in the cycle of 
      existence solely as a result of extraspective clinging to other objects. 
      Thus, once you have become aware of this situation, you may fathom the 
      depths of your own being, gain mastery over yourself and that is spiritual 
      Awakening. This is like an insane person regaining his senses. In that 
      analogy, until you come to your senses and gain control of your mind, 
      whatever you do, there is no way for it to be anything but insane conduct. 
      Likewise, until awareness identifies itself and fathoms its own depths, 
      there is no way that good or bad deeds can make you into a buddha. So know 
      this! </font></p>

      unique to the Great Perfection tradition. It refers to the awareness of 
      Samantabhadra, which is of the oceanic nature of the embodiments and 
      primordial wisdoms having six qualities: (1) externally luminous 
      consciousness is withdrawn into itself, and the great, internally

      supreme yana, the profound and secret Great Perfection, are there, or are 
      there not, pitfalls and obstacles that lead to mistakes? If there are 
      such, may the Teacher explain what they are!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, when first establishing the profound view, there is the danger 
      of mistaking understanding for realization. How so? Understanding is just 
      taking in the oral explanation of your teacher. This is like memorizing 
      the words of a textbook without examining their meaning. By merely 
      reciting what you have heard, without fathoming its meaning, you may have 
      the conceit of thinking, 'I know it,' [351] but it has really not reached 
      your mind-stream. That is just understanding, but it is not realization. 
      One who arrogantly takes this for realization is like someone who has 
      never seen a king's treasury and has no claim on it, but who has heard 
      others' reports about the treasury and memorized them, and then thinks, 
      'That is my treasury.' This is utterly pointless. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for realization, 
      whether it concerns explanations by your teacher, seeing the real meaning 
      of the tantras, oral transmissions, or practical instructions, or 
      something that emerges from the expanse of your own wisdom, first you may 
      understand just a fraction. Then with that as a catalyst, you repeatedly 
      investigate, and come to a subtle, exact knowledge of how all appearing 
      phenomena are nonobjective and empty from their own side. Finally, you 
      decisively fathom the one taste of great emptiness, the fact that all of 
      samsara and nirvana naturally arises from the expanse of the ground and is 
      not established as anything else. That is realization. If you lacked firm, 
      vast, and profound wisdom that does not entertain the slightest doubt 
      about this, and the entire world, together with its gods, were to teach 
      you repeatedly that samsara and nirvana are substantial, permanent, 
      stable, and immutable, you would turn&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">back from the path of 
      liberation. [352] The nature of realization is that of meditation, for 
      there is no meditation superior to realization. First you understand, then 
      you gain experience, and finally you reach the depths of realization. 
      Without that, there is nothing deserving the labels of the view or 
      meditation, for there is not even a trace of them. So be aware of the 
      indispensability of firm realization arising in one's mind-stream. </font>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Not knowing how to 
      distinguish between realization and gaining confidence, many people 
      mistake one for the other and thereby deceive themselves. So learn how to 
      make that distinction. Realization refers to correctly knowing with 
      certainty the manner in which the nature of the grounds and paths and the 
      triad of samsara, nirvana, and the path are all completely present in 
      awareness itself. There are many people who say that the knowledge of 
      those who go through great hardships, experiencing a myriad of joys and 
      sorrows, is genuine realization, but the knowledge of those who gain 
      immediate insight into the nature of reality does not count as 
      realization. That is incorrect. Consider this analogy: some very devout 
      people wishing to make a pilgrimage to the three types of holy 
      representations in Lhasa, Samye, and so on, courageously make a long and 
      arduous journey to those places of pilgrimage and encounter those holy 
      representations. [353] Some other people who were born in those pilgrimage 
      sites also encounter those holy representations, without hardship or any 
      display of courage. There is no difference in the encounters of those two 
      groups of people. What they are encountering is the three types of 
      representations, and there is no difference in those encounters. Moreover, 
      the unimpeded knowledge of all the outer, inner, and secret 
      representations on the part of those who were born in those holy places is 
      the same. Likewise; there is not the slightest difference between (1) one 
      who identifies reality-itself, the mode of existence of suchness, after 
      experiencing many hardships, joys, and sorrows,&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">and (2) one who 
      establishes, by means of discerning primordial wisdom, the 
      identitylessness of all the phenomena of samsara and nirvana, and then 
      directly realizes and knows the mode of existence of reality-itself. What 
      each one needs to do is to ascertain reality-itself, the mode of existence 
      of suchness, and identify the awareness that is present as the ground.&nbsp; 
      There is no difference there whatsoever.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Realizing, 
      ascertaining, and fathoming the meaning is called the view. As for gaining 
      confidence, first you identify [awareness], then you bring forth inactive, 
      wonderfully spacious awareness, and by practicing that unterruptedly, 
      [354] finally you achieve stability within yourself. Then without any 
      deviation in terms of times or situations--like the absence of darkness 
      once dawn has broken--it is said that you have gained confidence for 
      yourself. As soon as you first gain realization, if you do not gain 
      confidence by applying yourself to practice, even though you have 
      identified your own essential nature, you will die as an ordinary person, 
      and you will have to wander in the cycle of existence. As analogies to 
      this, even if you possess a mountain of food but do not eat it, it will be 
      of no use and you will die of starvation; and even if you own a castle 
      filled with clothing, if you do not wear it, you will die from exposure to 
      the elements. Therefore, recognize the vital importance of gaining 
      confidence.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you do not know how 
      to distinguish between the mind and awareness, you will confuse the mind 
      for awareness, which will unfortunately lead to obstacles to the state of 
      liberation. So know how to distinguish them! As for the mind, there is the 
      deluded mind that clings to appearances, the mind that seeks the path by 
      way of negation and affirmation, and the mind that makes consciousness its 
      path.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The deluded mind that 
      clings to appearances is the ordinary mind of sentient beings who do not 
      seek the path and who do not see the entrances to&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 249 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">the real paths. The 
      mind that seeks the path is said to take the mind as its path, for in this 
      case, [355] the mind observes the mind, ideation is observed by ideation, 
      and one seeks the path of merely arousing pleasure and pain through 
      intellectual modifications and the acceptance and rejection [of virtue and 
      vice]. As for the mind that makes consciousness its path, the experience 
      of unceasing, ordinary consciousness, which is the ground of the mind, 
      does not entail realizing the view. Consequently, outer appearances are 
      reduced to something ethically neutral, and those appearances are taken to 
      be real, so reification is not counteracted; inwardly, your own body 
      appears to be ethically neutral, so the reification of grasping onto the 
      body is not counteracted; and since both outer and inner appearances are 
      taken to be ethically neutral and substantially existent, you do not 
      transcend the mind, so that, too, is called the mind. Even if that were 
      called awareness--like giving a boy's name to an unborn fetus--the 
      characteristic of ascertaining awareness in itself would not have been 
      realized. Not realizing samsara and nirvana as great emptiness is 
      non-awareness, and on the basis of the functions of awareness and 
      non-awareness, those terms are conventionally accepted. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Awareness first 
      establishes everything included in the phenomenal world of samsara and 
      nirvana as emptiness. [356] Just as the reflections of the planets and 
      stars in the ocean have no existence apart from the ocean, and yet they 
      are of the same nature as displays of the ocean; and just as rainbows in 
      the sky have no existence apart from the sky, and yet those appearances 
      are of the same nature as displays of the sky; in the same manner, 
      finally, one truly knows that things appear even though nothing exists 
      from the side of appearances, that all appearances of the animate and 
      inanimate world have no existence apart from the ground-sugatagarbha, and 
      yet those appearances are of the same nature as&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      ground-sugatagarbha. And with that knowledge, awareness manifests. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As if the dawn were 
      breaking in the sky, without need of meditation, one comprehends samsara 
      and nirvana as being totally subsumed within great Awakening. Without need 
      of examination, there is the self-awareness, without grasping, that the 
      whole of samsara and nirvana is like reflections of the planets and stars 
      in the ocean. Without need of modification, there is natural liberation in 
      the ground absolute nature, the great, pure equality of samsara and 
      nirvana. Without need of objectification, there is a spacious dissolution 
      into the great expanse, with no object, without obstruction, and without 
      intentionality .You experience and gain mastery over the inexhaustible 
      ornamental wheels of the bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and enlightened 
      activities of the jinas and jinaputras of the three times. Ultimately, 
      simply due to identifying the dharmakaya, the awareness that is present as 
      the ground, {357] you gain mastery over the life force of samsara and 
      nirvana. This is not like articulating circumstances involving such things 
      as water and multicolored paper that are used to give rise to a mind that 
      receives initiation. Rather, you know you have obtained the empowerments 
      of the jinas and jinaputras and the oral transmissions of all the writings 
      that emerge from the primordial wisdom of awareness. Thus, you have 
      already, simultaneously obtained all empowerments and oral transmissions. 
      Therefore, recognize the importance of not mistaking the mind for 
      awareness.</font></p>

      to distinguish between cognition and wisdom, you will confuse cognition 
      for wisdom, as a result of which you run the danger of wasting your entire 
      life. So know how to distinguish them! Cognition is the mind of every 
      sentient being, which serves as the basis for the emergence of all 
      ideation. It is the limpid, clear nature of the unceasing flow of objects,
