      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Vast as the absolute 
      nature of reality, [470]<br>
      Beautifully arranged and adorned, is a great palace.<br>
      From an A in its center appears the original ground-dharmakaya [Samantabhadra],<br>
      Dark blue, like a lapis-lazuli mountain,<br>
      Naked and unadorned, he sits cross-legged upon a lotus and moon.<br>
      His hands are in the mudra of meditative equipoise, and he blazes<br>
      with the light of the signs and symbols of enlightenment.<br>
      The displays of myriads of buddha-fields are all present in this 
      embodiment.<br>
      Like a dream instantly dissolving into the absolute nature,<br>
      Your appearances and mental states indivisibly, of one taste,<br>
      Are transferred to the absolute nature of the great bliss of Akanista.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">With &quot;A,&quot; the animate 
      and inanimate world of the three realms dissolves into that buddha-field, 
      becoming indivisible with it. Uttering &quot;A,&quot; recognize this and bring it to 
      mind. Uttering &quot; A,&quot; imagine that you achieve great confidence. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">To the east imagine 
      the vast and spacious buddha-field of Abhirati filling the entire sky and 
      intervening appearances, white and luminous like a full moon, the color of 
      conch. To the south imagine the vast and spacious buddha-field of Srimat 
      blazing throughout the entire sky, intervening appearances, and the earth, 
      like the color of gold. To the west imagine the vast and spacious buddha- 
      field of Sukhavati, red like the color of ruby. To the north imagine the 
      buddha field of Karmaprapurana, like the color of emerald, with dimensions 
      equal to the absolute nature of reality. [471]&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 327 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Imagine yourself as a 
      bodhisattva imbued with the power and might of primordial wisdom. Starting 
      from the east, imagine that you proceed to those buddha-fields like an 
      arrow shot by a powerful archer, and imagine that you thrice 
      circumambulate the tathagatas who are the lords of the buddha-classes. You 
      make prostrations and immeasurable offerings, and you receive 
      empowerments, hear practical instructions, and receive oral transmissions 
      and blessings. Imagine that you then return to the buddha-field of 
      Ghanavyuha in the center, where the dharmakaya, the buddha of the original 
      ground, is present in the space in front of you. Those are the practical 
      instructions called transferring one's own appearance to a buddha-field 
      and entering therein. In the intermediate state when you recognize that 
      you have died, simply by bringing this to mind, the appearances of the 
      intermediate state will shift to a buddha-field, and you will achieve 
      liberation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Second, the 
      transitional process of meditative stabilization is like the situation of 
      an exhausted person taking a rest. Why? For lifetimes during the 
      beginningless cycle of existence, like rabid stray dogs, sentient beings 
      wander aimlessly throughout the states of existence of the three realms, 
      [472] without a moment's rest. Here is a way to recognize that situation 
      and bring forth a sense of disillusionment and disgust. Examine the 
      delusive causes and conditions in the past, and recognize how they 
      established a foundation of ignorance, and how you then became possessed 
      by the great demon of dualistic grasping, which crazed you and left you 
      with no self-mastery or stability. Then take control of your vital 
      energies and mind and establish confidence on the basis of firm 
      mindfulness and introspection. Let your awareness hold its own ground, and 
      strive in the practice of meditation. Just that provides the rest from 
      delusion on the basis of meditative stabilization.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 328 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At this point, you are 
      like someone suffering from hunger and thirst who comes upon food and 
      drink and unsatiatingly partakes of them until he is full. Likewise, 
      people of superior, middling, and inferior faculties may be likened to a 
      calf. First it lives on milk; when it has grown up somewhat, it lives on 
      both grass and milk; and finally it forsakes milk and lives on grass 
      alone. In a similar progression, first you stop and subdue the compulsive 
      ideation of your vital energies and mind, and release and let thoughts 
      manifest. The phase of alternatingly concentrating and releasing is like 
      the period when the calf lives on milk. If it stayed in that phase [473] 
      and did not come upon grass, it would surely die of starvation. Likewise, 
      if you do not encounter the manifest path, you will not transcend the 
      lower states of mundane existence, and you will continue wandering there.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Once consciousness has 
      manifested and you practice single-pointedly, if you remain in that state 
      and do not eventually encounter all-pervasive awareness, the originally 
      pure, ground-awareness itself, the Great Perfection free of extremes, you 
      will not transcend the three realms of mundane existence, and you will be 
      cast into the ocean of the miseries of samsara as you were&nbsp; before. This 
      is analogous to the time when the calf needs both grass and milk and dies 
      of starvation if it does not get either one. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Once you have 
      ascertained samsara and nirvana as great emptiness, identified dharmakaya 
      awareness, until you reach the state of omniscient, perfect awakening, 
      disengage from all manner of activities. Practicing by way of naturally 
      settled conduct, free of activity, is like the calf living on grass alone, 
      without reliance upon milk. If you remain at the point where you have 
      merely identified awareness, you will be like someone who does not eat or 
      satisfy his hunger and thirst even though he has food. Such a person will 
      surely die. Likewise, if your practice does not encompass death, you will 
      be involved in&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 329 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">hopes and fears 
      concerning all good and bad things of the present. [474] If this happens, 
      you will be deluded throughout the endless cycle of existence by dualistic 
      appearances of yourself and others and by thoughts of clinging to hopes 
      and fears concerning the good and the bad. So recognize this! Therefore, 
      your must bear in mind the utmost importance of practicing with zeal and 
      great&nbsp; courage until the state of liberation and omniscience has 
      manifested. Both living and meditative stabilization are called 
      transitional processes, for both take transitional states of consciousness 
      as their basis. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Third, the delusive 
      transitional process of dreams appears in the following way.&nbsp; Some people 
      may say that daytime appearances arise as dream appearances. However, from 
      the primordial beginning of time, the face of the ground absolute nature, 
      free of the eight extremes of conceptual elaboration, and the displays of 
      the divine embodiments and primordial wisdoms, has been veiled by 
      ignorance. Then one is possessed by the intoxicated demon of the three 
      realms of samsara, the great fiend of the karmic energies, which allows 
      the inner mind of grasping to act as the primary cause, and outer grasped 
      objects to act as contributing conditions. Daytime appearances then emerge 
      due to the reification of the appearances of the five senses; and once 
      they have dissolved into the absolute nature, dream appearances emerge. 
      The appearances of this life and all that follows indicate the fallacy of 
      the notion that daytime appearances are true and dream appearances are 
      false. [475] As for the causes and conditions of both daytime appearances 
      and dream appearances, that which serves as the cause is the dormant 
      consciousness that perceives identityless, dependently related events as 
      bearing their own identities. That which has the capacity to give rise to 
      limpid, clear objects serves as the contributing condition. Due to the 
      confluence of those causes and conditions, a nondual, continuous 
      collection brings forth delusive appearances that do not actually exist.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 330 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Taking the 
      comprehension of that as your basis, train in regarding all appearances as 
      dreams, then identify dream appearances themselves. By so doing, if you 
      achieve confidence by growing accustomed to awareness holding its own 
      ground, the appearances of the intermediate state will be cut off, and you 
      will gain mastery over the great bounty of reality-itself. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Fourth, that which is 
      called the transitional process of dying is like falling into the hands of 
      an evil assassin, and it refers to the period from the time&nbsp; you are 
      struck by a deadly disease until your breath ceases. First of all, when 
      you are struck by an illness, carefully check to see whether or not the 
      vapor [from your feces] has stopped, check your vision by placing your 
      fist on your forehead, see whether the form of your space-vitality has 
      vanished79,&nbsp; like the sun descending behind a mountain peak, and note 
      whether the hum in your ears has disappeared. [476] Then apply yourself to 
      ritual practices and so on for the sake of accumulating merit.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If that does not help, 
      take a good friend who has not broken his samayas with you to a solitary 
      place free of other people and disturbing influences. At your heart 
      visualize a large white syllable A, with twenty- one white A's stacked on 
      top of it. Recite &quot;A&quot; twenty-one times, and as you do so, imagine them 
      merging upwards, until, with the sound of &quot;PHAT,&quot; the topmost white A 
      merges into the great bliss of Akanista, the space of the Buddha 
      Samantabhadra of the original ground. As a result of then resting in this 
      all-pervasiveness, vapor may rise from your Brahma. aperture or your 
      breath may stop, and these are signs of achieving liberation in space.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you cannot achieve 
      transference by that means, lie down in the lion's posture, direct your 
      attention to your eyes, and steadily focus your eyes on the </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">79 With this practice 
      you place your fist on your forehead, and if you can see right through it, 
      with no interval between the left and right sides of your vision, then 
      &quot;the form of your space- vitality&quot; has vanished.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 331 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">intervening space in 
      front of you. Then imagine your body, mind, and all appearances 
      simultaneously fading into the form of a five-colored mass of light. By 
      taking this appearance of light as your path and settling there in 
      meditative equipoise, your breath may come to a stop and you may achieve 
      liberation with no intermediate state. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Alternatively, have 
      your companion say three times in a loud voice, 'O you child of good 
      breeding, in the space one cubit above the top of your head sits the 
      Bhagavan, the original ground-dharmakaya, Samantabhadra, the buddha who 
      dwells in neither of the extremes of mundane existence or nirvana, whose 
      body is blue in color, naked, and adorned with the signs and symbols of 
      enlightenment. Merge your consciousness with the nonconceptual, primordial 
      wisdom of his mind. Each time this is said, have your companion utter the 
      sound &quot;HI KA&quot; three times. By so doing, if your eyes roll upwards, that's 
      the measure of success.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you do not die as a 
      result of that, when your breath goes out and the appearances of external 
      objects fade away, have your companion stick a hollow bamboo or a tube of 
      paper into your ear and say into it three times, 'O you child of good 
      breeding, when the white and red phases of dissolution arise for you, that 
      is the reversal of the cycle of existence. Merge with the ground absolute 
      nature, free of conceptual elaboration, the originally pure, primordial 
      ground; and transfer there!' He should also utter the sound &quot;PHAT&quot; three 
      times.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If your breath does 
      not cease by that means either, have your companion say, &quot;Child of good 
      breeding, dissolve your consciousness into a white syllable A and, like an 
      arrow shot by a powerful archer, transfer it from your Brahma aperture to 
      the realm of pristine space.&quot; That counsel will bring greater clarity to 
      the dying process, and it is like a message sent by a king. [478]&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 332 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you derive no 
      benefit in those ways either from the transference by your own power or by 
      the assistance of someone else, the sign of the pervasive wind escaping is 
      the deterioration of the complexion and radiance of your body; the sign of 
      the fire-accompanying wind escaping is the loss of all bodily warmth in 
      the limbs and so on so that you become as cold as a stone; the sign of the 
      descending wind escaping is the outflow of all the vital essences of the 
      body; and the signs of the ascending wind escaping are the expulsion of 
      the breath, food and drink that have been ingested through the mouth 
      emerging from the nose, and drooling of saliva and mucus. Due to 
      interference between the vital energies of the channels and elements and 
      the blood, various delusive appearances arise. Eventually the blood 
      converges in the life force channel, the vital energies are expelled, and 
      awareness collapses into the center of the heart. Now you have come to 
      what is called the separation of the vital energies and the mind. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Up until that point, 
      consciousness gradually dissolves into appearances, giving rise to a red 
      vision that is like a flash of lightning. The sign that the [red] vision 
      is dissolving into the [red] emergence is the appearance of a red vision 
      like the rising sun.&nbsp; [479] After that, the sign that the [red] emergence 
      is dissolving into the [dark] attainment is a vision of darkness that is 
      like twilight. When you fall unconscious in that state, you have died.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At these times 
      recognizing these stages of dissolution, as if you were a lovely woman 
      gazing at herself in a mirror, is of great importance. Those of superior 
      faculties follow the instructions on entering into the clear light. Those 
      of middling faculties reverse the impure appearances and mental states of 
      samsara back into displays of the clear light, reality-itself. By 
      recognizing the stages of dissolution, it is most important that even 
      those of inferior faculties establish confidence in the immediate clear 
      light.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 333 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Due to the influence 
      of people's faculties, some remain unconscious in that state for six 
      hours, for twelve hours, for one full day, or for two or three days. 
      However long they stay there, that is the phase when one dissolves into 
      the authentic, immediate total-ground. Following that is so-called the 
      dissolution of the [dark] attainment into the clear light. As an analogy, 
      just as the space inside a jar is united with the space outside, without 
      even a speck of any appearance of a self, a limpid, clear expanse arises 
      like all-pervasive space, free of contamination, like dawn breaking in the 
      sky. [480] At this time, people who are already very familiar with 
      ground-awareness by means of the Breakthrough and have gained confidence 
      in this will recognize the junction of the awareness in which they have 
      previously trained--which is like a familiar person--and the later 
      immediate clear light. There they must hold their own ground, like a king 
      sitting upon his throne.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">For those who have 
      taken the Breakthrough as their path, without knowing the Leap-over or 
      gaining success in its practice, this occasion is a critical juncture, 
      like conducting heart surgery.80 Once they have recognized awareness, if 
      they can establish confidence, that is called liberation in the clear 
      light of the dharmakaya during the dying process, and that is like 
      surviving by removing fluid from the heart. If they do not recognize 
      awareness or establish confidence, they will endlessly wander in the 
      delusive cycle of existence, and that is like perforating the heart with a 
      golden tube, in which case death is certain. The number of days one 
      remains in meditative stabilization in the clear light of the dying 
      process corresponds to the stability and duration of one's present 
      practice. Those who have achieved stability lasting an entire day and 
      night may achieve stability lasting seven human days; but for those who 
      have not entered the path </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">the clear light will 
      not appear longer than the time it takes to eat a bowl of food. [481]
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Fifth, as for the 
      transitional process of reality-itself, for those who see the entrance to 
      the clear light great Leap-over and then apply themselves to the practice 
      sporadically, knowledge arises simply by a self-appearance called 
      dissolution into the spontaneously present clear light. All appearing 
      objects wherever they look are completely filled and pervaded by a great 
      radiance of light, like brocade filled with rainbows. That is like a 
      sprout of rice. Thereafter, like the emergence of a bundle of rice, 
      numerous bindus appear, ranging in size to those as expansive as the sky 
      to those as small as fish eyes, and they pervade and fill everything. Like 
      the ripening of a bundle of rice, first in the midst of one large bindu 
      the principle deities Vairocana and his consort appear surrounded by four 
      male and female bodhisattvas. From the hearts of those deities white light 
      spreads forth, too brilliant to look at, penetrating the crown of one's 
      head. Upon it, bindus appear to stack up like hollow conch bowls. That is 
      called the hollow path of Vairocana. Simultaneously with that appears the 
      path of animals, [482] which is blue and faintly luminous. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">When you come to this 
      point, the child-like clear light in which you have trained previously and 
      the subsequently arising mother-like luminosity converge. As a result, 
      like a child unhesitatingly crawling onto its mother's lap, when your 
      consciousness enters into the clear light, you will achieve liberation in 
      the great bliss of union.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you are not 
      liberated at that point due to failing to recognize the clear light, all 
      appearances transform into displays of red light. In the midst of that 
      light the principle deity Amitabha with his consort, surrounded by four 
      male and female bodhisattvas, appears inside a bindu that reaches from the 
      earth to the sky. From the hearts of those divine embodiments red light 
      spreads forth,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      throat, in which bindus become stacked up like hollow ruby bowls. 
      Simultaneously, a pale red pathway of pretas, devoid of any luster, 
      arises. At this time, for those who recognize their appearances, this 
      merges and transforms into divine embodiments and brilliant light, and if 
      they achieve confidence without being distracted elsewhere, they will 
      achieve liberation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you are not 
      liberated due to failing to recognize that, all appearances become 
      completely veiled and pervaded by a dark blue light, [483] in the midst of 
      which appears the principle deity Aksobhya with his consort, surrounded by 
      the four male and four female bodhisattvas. He is adorned with the signs 
      and symbols of enlightenment and with the garments of a sambhogakaya. From 
      their hearts dark blue light spreads forth, too brilliant to look at, 
      penetrating your heart, in which bindus become stacked up like hollow 
      lapis-lazuli bowls. Simultaneously, beneath that arises a black-light 
      pathway of hell beings, devoid of any luster. At this time as well, if 
      your consciousness merges into the absolute nature of the divine 
      embodiments and you hold your own ground with confidence, you will achieve 
      liberation in the buddha-field of Abhirati. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you are not 
      liberated at that point, all appearances transform and emerge into 
      displays of yellow light, in the midst of which appears a vast, expansive 
      yellow bindu, like a rhinoceros-skin shield. Inside it appears a 
      variegated lotus, sun, and moon seat, on which sits the Bhagavan 
      Ratnasambhava, his body the color of refined gold, adorned with 
      sambhogakaya garments. Embracing his consort, their glory and aura is too 
      brilliant to look at. On their right is the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, on 
      their left is the Bodhisattva Akasagarbha, [484] in front of them is the 
      Bodhisattvi Mamalema, and behind them is the Bodhisattvi Dhuspe, blazing 
      with light like refined gold shining in the sunlight. From the hearts of 
      those divine embodiments yellow light spreads forth, penetrating your 
      navel, where amber bindus stack up like hollow amber&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">bowls. Simultaneously, 
      beneath them arises the white pathway of the devas, devoid of brilliance. 
      If you recognize Ratnasambhava in this hollow path and merge your 
      awareness with him, you will gain mastery over the southern buddha-field 
      of Srimat and you will achieve liberation. Those are called the paths of 
      union with the four primordial wisdoms. In the first instant of this very 
      secret, unsurpassed, swift path there is recognition; in the second, you 
      achieve confidence; and in the third you achieve liberation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">You may not be able to 
      gaze at the luminous path of purity, in which case your attention cannot 
      be placed there; but by merging with the four impure paths and focusing on 
      them, you will take birth in those states of existence. Until you perfect 
      the power of progress in meditative experience, the hollow path of 
      Amoghasiddhi will not appear, and from the time that the power of progress 
      in meditative experience has been perfected, [485] up until the phase of 
      reaching consummate awareness, buddhahood will be achieved without an 
      intermediate state, and those visions will not appear. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then the appearances 
      of the embodiments and bindus decrease, and from your brain all the 
      mandalas of the displays of the blood-drinkers disperse and spread out up 
      into the sky, like sparks from a fire. From each one of them countless 
      others are emanated, pervading and filling all the realms of the universe. 
      Rays of light beam forth from their eyes like the light from a hundred 
      thousand suns and moons. With their mouths gaping open, and their teeth 
      bared like the moon, their moustaches aflame, and lightning flashing from 
      their eyebrows, they are replete with charnel ground garments. In the 
      midst of flames like the conflagration at the end of the eon, they hold 
      aloft various weapons and bellow forth HUM PHAT and the words &quot;Strike! 
      Kill&quot;&nbsp; like the simultaneous roaring of a thousand peals of thunder. 
      Various headed creatures brandish weapons and dance around. When seeing 
      these appearances of&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      and hearing their ferocious roars, the assemblies of Yama, the Lord of 
      Death, are intimidated and terrified. If you recognize them all&nbsp; as direct 
      appearances of the emanated peaceful and wrathful mandalas of the vajra-city 
      of your aggregates,81 [486] and have the power to fuse with them nondually, 
      you will achieve liberation in the volcanic charnel ground of Akanista.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">For those who have 
      succeeded in the training and have become acquainted with the path of the 
      great clear light Leap-over, all those peaceful and wrathful appearances 
      of lights and bindus will appear over a period of seven weeks of days of 
      meditative stabilization*; and they will have time to gain recognition and 
      liberation by the power of that sustained experience. For those who have 
      not seen the entrance to the path of the clear light Great Perfection, or 
      those who have seen it but have not practiced or succeeded in the training 
      due to an absence of confident recognition, and due to spiritual sloth, 
      distraction, and succumbing to amusements, those lights and bindus will 
      not appear longer than the duration of an eclipse. Thus, it goes without 
      saying that they will not have time to recognize them or gain liberation.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">When all such peaceful 
      and wrathful appearances vanish into the absolute nature, you will recall 
      all the types of Dharma you have heard in the past, but they are forgotten 
      as soon as they are remembered. Moreover, this is a phase when innumerable 
      types of Dharma that you have never before heard or understood appear, and 
      as soon as they do so, they are forgotten. For the most part, people 
      experience the vision of the clear light for a short time, and they remain 
      in this state only briefly. [487] As soon as they remember their guru, for 
      those with faith, reverence, and great adoration for their spiritual 
      mentors, the self-appearing Teacher of such disciples may appear as their 
      guru and show them the way to liberation; and they may indeed attain 
      liberation.</font></p>

      demarcation between life and death, they fall to vajra hell with no

      to their guru or vajra siblings and who have well succeeded in their 
      practice of the Breakthrough and the Leap-over ascend into a fathomless 
      expanse. After their outer breath has ceased and before their inner breath 
      has stopped, with no demarcation between life and death, they are 
      naturally liberated within themselves, with no intermediate state. Like

      instructions, it is especially important to examine, investigate, and 
      properly understand the teachings on the way the intermediate state arises 
      and then to apply them to your own experience. So comprehend this! After 
      the inconceivable transitional process of reality-itself is completed, 
      this is the way you go astray in the sixth, karmic transitional process of 
      becoming. [488] Moved by karmic energies, your consciousness is unable to 
      go to the absolute nature of reality, the vajra seat,82 or your [future] 
      mother's womb. But apart from those two, it moves freely and unimpededly 
      through all concrete, material&nbsp; things such as earth, stone, mountains, 
      boulders, and trees. It is complete with a self-appearing, empty image 
      just like your previous physical form, and all your senses are present. 
      Thus, objects appear just as they are, and you have mastery of various 
      kinds of paranormal abilities. You are endowed with divine vision by

      such a being also cannot go to this or her future mother's womb.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

      various beings similar to yourself, and you are aware of the thoughts of 
      attachment and anger in the minds of others. At times, when you are in the 
      presence of humans, you hear their conversations, but they neither hear 
      nor respond to your responses. Thinking that they are all mad at you, you 
      may feel anger yourself. Even when you are with your spouse, he or she 
      gives you no food. Noting that you cast no shadow in the sunlight and no 
      reflection of you appears in a mirror, and that you leave no tracks in 
      sand, soft earth, or fluid and so on, you feel perplexed and come to know 
      that you have died. Then you experience immeasurable terror and misery. 
      [489] When you go for refuge to those making devotions to the guru, you 
      see that they are conducting the rituals improperly, that they have no no 
      practice of the stage of generation or completion, and that they have many 
      other faults such as breaking their samayas and vows. Thinking that you 
      have been duped by these people and that you will be cast into a miserable 
      state of existence, false views arise. Ardently yearning to adopt a body 
      quickly, you rove about in all directions, looking for an entrance to a 
      womb. But during the intermediate state, until its time has run its 
      course, you do not see or find an entrance to a womb. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">After each period of 
      seven days has passed, the appearances of the prior conditions for your 
      death arise, producing immense suffering. You hear four terrifying sounds: 
      the sound of a thousand mountains crumbling to pieces, the sound of a 
      raging ocean, the sound of a blazing bonfire, and the roaring sound of the 
      wind. White, red, and black abysses appear, which are natural forms of the 
      three poisons, and you experience unbearable horror that you will fall 
      into them. Unbearable, delusive appearances arise such as being chased by 
      soldiers&nbsp; and assassins, a great mountain tumbling down upon you, and a 
      violent storm bearing down upon you. At times you appear in the form of 
      your previous body, and at times you appear in the form of your next 
      body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">A sign that you will 
      be reborn in either a deva or human state is that your&nbsp; head turns upward; 
      [490] a sign that you will be reborn either as an asura or an animal is 
      that you look horizontally; and a sign that you will be reborn as a hell 
      being or a preta is that you look downwards. A sign that you will be 
      reborn in hell is the appearance of a stump-like pillar of black light; 
      for a preta rebirth it is an appearance like dangling black wool; for an 
      animal rebirth it is an appearance like an ocean of blood; for a human 
      rebirth it is an appearance of white light; for an asura rebirth it is an 
      appearance of green light; and for a deva rebirth it is a white light one 
      fathom long. As for your stream of consciousness, for rebirth in a 
      formless realm you take great delight in vacuity; for rebirth in a form 
      realm<br>
      you crave clarity; for rebirth as a deva of the desire realm you crave 
      bliss; for human rebirth you crave objects; for rebirth as an asura you 
      desire snow and rain; for rebirth as an animal you yearn for dark light; 
      for rebirth as a preta you are drawn to pale red light; and for rebirth in 
      hell you are attracted to tongues of fire. All those objects appear to you 
      to be beautiful and attractive, and you feel an irresistible attraction to 
      them.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you become 
      acquainted with these points starting right now and take them to heart, 
      you may recognize these signs in the present, experience the dharmakaya, 
      the awareness that is present as the ground, establish confidence in that, 
      and the ground clear light, the originally pure dharmakaya, will&nbsp; appear 
      again. That is like repairing a broken irrigation channel, and you will 
      thereby achieve liberation. [491] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Alternatively, you may 
      bring to mind the buddha-field, palace, and chosen deity on which you have 
      meditated in the past, and if you hold your ground in that, your 
      appearances will shift to them, and you will be liberated. Moreover, if 
      you have manifested a pristine buddha-field, which brings enormous relief, 
      and have established habitual propensities in your mind for that, upon 
      recalling them&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 341 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">and accurately 
      bringing them to mind, your appearances will shift to them, and you will 
      achieve stability.Those who lack such habitual propensities through 
      practice may see a beautiful mass of fire, and as soon as they come into 
      its midst, visions of hell emerge and they suffer. By going into a lovely 
      cave, preta appearances arise; by entering a river or a swamp, animal 
      appearances emerge; by going into a fine rain or a fierce blizzard, asura 
      appearances arise; and due to the appearances of such things as a garden 
      and a palace, you enter rebirth as a deva.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for grasping onto a 
      human environment, the eastern world sector of Videha appears in the form 
      of a fish; Godaniya appears in the form of a swan; Uttarakuru appears in 
      the form of a crane; and Jambudvipa appears in the form of a man and a 
      woman in sexual union. At this time, if you block the entrance to the womb 
      and bring to mind the preceding points, you may still achieve liberation. 
      [492] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Alternatively, if you 
      do enter a womb, in the presence of a man and woman in sexual union who 
      are of a fine heritage and who dwell in the vicinity of an excellent 
      spiritual friend, where Dharma is flourishing in Jambudvipa, which is the 
      foremost of all the world sectors, with attraction for your mother and 
      aversion for your father, you may unhesitatingly enter her womb by way of 
      her anus. At that time, if you can imagine yourself in the form of your 
      spiritual mentor or your chosen deity and pray to be of great service to&nbsp; 
      the&nbsp; world, you will certainly achieve a precious human rebirth endowed 
      with the eighteen types of leisure and endowment. It is important to know 
      that if you enter the womb with attraction for your father and aversion 
      for your mother, you will be reborn as a girl. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Nowadays to practice

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">intermediate state.&quot; 
      Then rest for awhile in a state of recognizing samsara and nirvana as 
      great emptiness. Then think, &quot;I have really died. This is the transitional 
      process of becoming. Now I must engage in a method for escaping from this 
      miserable dungeon of samsara.&quot; Then bring to mind the buddha-field of 
      Abhirati to the east, and imagine white light, like a mass of clouds, 
      illuminating the sky to the further reaches to the east. [493] That buddha-field 
      is vast and spacious, unimaginably immense. Its surface is smooth, even, 
      limpid, and clear like&nbsp; the surface of a mirror. It is filled and 
      blanketed with lotus blossoms of different colors. When you press down 
      upon it, it gives way, and when you lift up, it rebounds. The four 
      cardinal directions and eight intermediate directions are adorned with 
      wish-fulfilling trees. Springs of purifying ambrosia flow forth. Jewel 
      pebbles, turquoise meadows, and gold sand surround lakes and ponds of 
      ambrosia bearing the eight excellent qualities. In the midst of checkered 
      patterns of rainbows, many goddesses bring forth offering clouds of 
      sensual delights. Flocks of many exquisite emanated birds with lovely 
      voices sing melodies of Dharma. In the sky appear forms such as canopies, 
      parasols, and silk pennants formed from rainbows. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Imagine that in the 
      center of this buddha-field is a palace created from the brilliant light 
      of primordial wisdom. Vast and spacious, it is resplendent with white, 
      yellow, red, green, and blue hues. [494] It is well designed and is 
      replete with all manner of lovely decorations and attributes. In its 
      center is a jeweled throne supported by eight elephants, on which is a 
      lotus, sun, and moon seat. On it sits the Bhagavan Vajrasattva, his body 
      white in color, adorned with the signs and symbols of enlightenment and 
      with all the attire of a sambhogakaya. This supreme, illusory embodiment 
      of primordial wisdom is surrounded by an inconceivable assembly of 
      bodhisattvas.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then imagine that you 
      ascend to that buddha-field, like an arrow shot by a powerful archer, and 
      you circumambulate that palace three times. You confess your sins and 
      nonvirtues. Upon your request, the gatekeeper opens the door, you enter 
      the palace, and pay homage, make offerings, confess your sins, and pray to 
      the Tathagata. The Tathagata beholds you with great mercy and blesses&nbsp;you, 
      makes a prophecy concerning you, grants you empowerments, and you sit down 
      among those to whom he is teaching the Dharma. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you succeed in the 
      practice of transforming your appearances, during the transitional process 
      of becoming, [495] as soon as you recognize that you have died, by the 
      power of the habitual propensities in which you have trained previously, 
      with the aspiration to be liberated from samsara, you may recall that 
      buddha-field and accurately bring it to mind. Then by focusing your desire 
      to go there, you will have the fortune to arrive there, like an arrow shot 
      by a strong archer; and you will achieve stability in that buddha-field.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Occasionally bring to 
      mind the buddha-field of Srimat to the south, in which the whole sky and 
      earth blazes like the color of gold. In its center is the Bhagavan 
      Ratnasambhava, the color of body like refined gold. He is surrounded by an 
      assembly of viras and yoginis of the jewel family, and you imagine 
      yourself arriving there and sitting before him as you did before. From&nbsp; 
      time to time, bring to mind the ruby-like buddha-field of Sukhavati to the 
      west, in the center of which is red Amitabha, surrounded by an assembly of 
      viras and yoginis of the lotus family. Imagine that you have arrived in 
      their presence. Occasionally bring to mind the buddha-field of 
      Karmaprapurana to the north, which is like the color of emerald. In its 
      center is the Bhagavan Amoghasiddhi, adorned with the attire of a 
      sambhogakaya, and surrounded by an assembly of viras and yoginis of the 
      karma family. [496] Imagine that you perceive the layout of the buddha-field 
      as if you were seeing it directly with your eyes, then imagine that you go 
      there&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      on to the Tathagata as before. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At times, imagine all 
      appearances as the buddha-field of your chosen deity. For example, as if 
      you were seeing with your eyes, imagine the regions to the east, south, 
      west, and north from the center of a vast region. To the east imagine the 
      buddha-field of Abhirati, adorned with white flowers and with white light 
      reaching up into the heavens; to the south imagine the buddha-field of&nbsp;Srimat, 
      adorned with yellow flowers and with yellow light reaching up into the 
      heavens; to the west imagine the buddha-field of Sukhavati, adorned with 
      red flowers and with red light reaching up into the heavens; and to the 
      north imagine the buddha-field of Karmaprapurana, adorned with green 
      flowers, and with green light reaching up into the heavens. Bringing them 
      to mind as if you were seeing them with your own eyes, bring forth 
      confidence in that state and dwell in that. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The practice of 
      occasionally imagining the appearances of going to those buddha-fields, as 
      if you were an arrow shot by a powerful archer and arriving there [497], 
      establishes a potency in your mind-stream that provides enormous relief in 
      the intermediate state. Therefore, recognize the supreme importance of 
      succeeding in the practice of these instructions and gaining stability in 
      your mind-stream with respect to this training. </font></p>

      impure entrances of samsara into pure reality-itself, like the autumn sky 
      free of the three contaminating conditions, an all-pervasive,

      well and bear this in mind! The appearances of light, light rays, [498] 
      bindus, and peaceful and wrathful divine embodiments that arise are said 
      to dissolve into originally pure, spontaneous presence. The sediments of 
      the elements emerge as the vital core, causing the vital core of the five 
      lights to ripen as the vital essence. The vital essence of the bindus of 
      that come to fruition as divine embodiments. Without letting your 
      consciousness be distracted elsewhere, merge with the light, like a child 
      crawling on its mother's lap. Merge your mind with the divine embodiments 
      and the bindus! Your own appearances are manifesting in the nature of the 
      clear light great bliss, so recognize this! Merge there, transfer there, 
      and establish confidence! Hold your own ground on the basis of that 
      confidence, and without being distracted to anything else, if you 
      undeludedly hold your own ground, you will become enlightened as a 
      sambhogakaya in the intermediate state. Do not be afraid of your own 
      appearances as the wrathful mandala. Do not be terrified of your own 
      sounds that appear to you. Do not fear the variously appearing rays, but 
      remain firm in the recognition of the ground-awareness as displays of the 
      totality of samsara and nirvana; and be infinitely pervasive.&quot;</font></p>

      arrived at the border between samsara and nirvana, so be disillusioned and 
      repelled by this cycle of existence, which is of the nature of suffering, 
      without even a moment of true happiness. These worlds of the six types of 
      existence of devas, humans, and so forth are delusive appearances, like 
      illusions and the realm of dreams; so forcefully cut off craving and 
      attachment. A world to the east of here called Abhirati is a buddha-field 
      graced with immeasurable joys and excellent qualities. There the Bhagavan 
      named Vajrasattva is revealing the Dharma and bringing blessings to an 
      immeasurable assembly of bodhisattvas. Bring that to mind! You have no 
      material aggregate of flesh and blood, so let your mental body of empty

      archer.&quot; By uttering PHAT, that person should imagine the dead one going

      Unless the dead person has a little familiarity with the stages of 
      generation and completion, it will be very difficult for that person to be 
      helped by such introductions. If these words of introduction come into the 
      hearing of someone who does have a little familiarity with the stages of

      awareness of the view, when the dying person experiences the dissolution 
      into the [dark] attainment, the guide should imagine the dying person's 
      consciousness as a stainless, clear, radiant, white syllable A, and should 
      call out the dying person's name three times, and say three times, &quot;O you 
      child of good breeding, imagine your consciousness as a stainless white 
      syllable A.&nbsp; O child of good breeding, the Brahma aperture on the crown of 
      your head, which is like a vent, is the pathway to ascend upwards into 
      openness. Transport yourself through there like a shooting star!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The guide should 
      nondually merge his own awareness with the consciousness of the other 
      person and remain for awhile in meditative equipoise. Then he should 
      imagine emerging from the Brahma aperture like the movement of a shooting 
      star, dissolving up into the realm of Akanista. After reciting A five 
      times, he should ascend while uttering PHAT three times. If the guide who 
      is imbued with the glories of primordial wisdom and excellent qualities 
      causes the vapor to rise from the Brahma aperture of the other person, 
      that is a sign of success. If that does not happen, imagine immeasurable 
      lights and light rays emanating from your heart, and all the jina mandalas 
      of the three&nbsp; embodiments completely melt and converge into the form of 
      five-colored masses of light. [502] Visualize in the space one cubit above 
      the crown of the head of the person who has died the Buddha Amitabha, 
      together with an assembly of bodhisattvas. At the heart of the Tathagata 
      imagine a lotus and moon seat on which sits the&nbsp; </font></p>

      Samantabhadra, one hand-span in height, naked, devoid of clothing or 
      ornaments. At his heart visualize a white syllable A, radiant like the 
      moon. From their bodies masses of five-colored light, spreading forth like 
      billowing clouds, enter the body, speech, and mind of the dead person. All 
      his mental states and appearances melt into light, and his body becomes an 
      empty pavilion of a body of light. In its center, those masses of light 
      draw together and bless the life principle, cognition, and mind of the 
      dead person, like placing a pillar in an empty abode of light. This tube 
      of light reaches upwards to the A at the heart of Samantabhadra and 
      extends downwards as far as the dead person's heart, where it stops. 
      Inside it, twenty-one white syllables A are stacked from the heart up to 
      the crown of the head, and imagine them to be of the essential nature of 
      the life principle, cognition, and mind of the dead person. Uttering A 
      PHAT twenty-one times, [503] imagine them gradually withdrawing upwards, 
      then imagine the uppermost A dissolving into the A at the heart of 
      Samantabhadra, like a shooting star. Uttering PHAT once, imagine the 
      emergence of the buddha-field of Sukhavati just as it actually is. 
      Uttering it a second time, imagine the dead person recognizing that buddha-field. 
      Uttering it a third time, imagine him perfecting the power and achieving 
      stability . This practice of bringing the buddha-field to mind and 
      sustaining that as long as you can is profound and potent when applied to 
      all manner of superior or inferior people. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If the guide does not 
      know essentials of the stage of generation and has no familiarity with 
      them, whatever he does, it will have no more power to benefit or protect 
      than simply offering ordinary prayers of supplication. Therefore, the 
      guides of the deceased should have confidence in the view and meditation, 
      and in order to accomplish the welfare of others, they should train in the 
      essentials of the stage of generation and of transference. If they do not 
      succeed in such practice, [when they pretend to guide the dead] they are 
      no&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      and bandits. By deceiving others, they trap themselves, like spiders who 
      get caught in their own webs. They pay the price for experiencing the 
      suffering of the miserable states of existence, so this should be 
      recognized. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This quintessential 
      tantra, a fundamental tantra, a space treasury of the sugatagarbha, with 
      its illumination of numerous entrances to the originally pure, primordial 
      wisdom of the youthful vase body, [504] is an entrance to methods for 
      natural liberation in the state of reality-itself. The reasons why such a 
      tantra has been revealed by myself, the original ground, the Teacher 
      Saroruhavajra, to my emanated circle of disciples, who are not other than 
      myself, are as follows. In earlier times, the teachings of the Great 
      Perfection shone like the sun; and when sublime, supreme teachers 
      explained them to people with [good] karma and fortune, first they would 
      gain certainty by way of the view; then they&nbsp; would identify [awareness] 
      and dispel their flaws by means of meditation; and finally, by remaining 
      in the conduct of inactivity and by practicing, they all became siddhas 
      and experienced the state of omniscient buddhahood. That is the 
      unsurpassed quality of the profound path of the Vajra Heart [Tantra]. 
      Nowadays, having no experience or familiarity with the view, and 
      identifying merely the natural clarity of consciousness, however people 
      meditate, they do not go beyond the ordinary; and there is no time when 
      they achieve the fruition of omniscient buddhahood. Some teachers are 
      expert at oral explanations, but they cannot show the path of liberation, 
      so it is impossible for them to bring much benefit to the minds of others. 
      Thus, teachers who can explain it are gradually becoming more and more 
      rare, and there is no on who is practicing. [505] As a result, the 
      teachings of the Great Perfection are lost to the point that they are 
      becoming like a drawing of a butter-lamp. This [tantra] has been revealed 
      because of the dependently originated circumstances of the animate and 
      inanimate world in such times as this.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 350 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Like the sun briefly 
      appearing through a break in the clouds, this will not remain for long. 
      Why? Because there are no teachers who know how to explain it, and there 
      are few people who have the karma, prayers, and fortune [to receive it]. 
      Thus, just as it has emerged from the absolute nature, it will withdraw 
      into it again.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At these words, the 
      entire assembly of disciples including Vidyavajra rejoiced and offered 
      praise. Immediately the Teacher Saroruhavajra dissolved into a mass of 
      light, and the disciples also vanished into that light. The light then 
      increased in size, pervading all appearances. All appearances dissolved 
      into light, and then the light merged with space. Space pervasively 
      expanded without bounds. Then from the nonobjective, empty absolute 
      nature, these words arose, &quot;O you people who practice the clear light 
      Vajra Heart, listen! That is the way to become enlightened as a display of 
      the equal purity of the nonduality of liberating oneself by means of 
      realization and liberating others by means of compassion. [ 506 ] </font>
