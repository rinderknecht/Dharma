      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">when it is not 
      contaminated by clouds, mist, or wind. Then self-awareness, limpid, clear, 
      and free of contamination, is nowhere limited in its dimensions. Without 
      veering in any direction, you come to the attainment of pervasiveness free 
      of all extremes of conceptual elaboration. Then the purifying clear light 
      of the time of the path, the primordial wisdom of awareness, identifies 
      itself; and by the power of that familiarization, [224] at the time of 
      fruition the inner depths are reached within yourself, resulting in 
      Awakening as the dharmakaya.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you do not have the 
      ability to be liberated in that way, the appearance of the ground clear 
      light which is grasped as the body to which you are experientially fixated 
      is the basis to be purified; and by arousing purifying awareness as the 
      causal syllable, gradually bring forth the appearance of a buddha-field. 
      By so doing, the manifest presentation of the fruition will come to you. 
      Therefore, know that it is of the utmost importance to familiarize 
      yourself with the three types of samadhi from now on. The clear light 
      emptiness that is present as the ground does not become manifest merely by 
      thinking and visualizing, so know that the result of that is nothing more 
      than that. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again dark blue light 
      in the form of e is emitted from the appearance of the causal syllable in 
      the foundationless domain of the primordial ground, emptiness. That 
      transforms into the nature of limpid, clear space, and green light in the 
      form of Yam is emitted, manifesting as the mandala of air. Red light in 
      the form of ra is emitted, manifesting as an ocean of blood completely 
      covered with waves. Kem is emitted, forming a triangular mountain of 
      skeletons, equal in dimensions with the absolute nature of reality. Ram is 
      emitted, becoming the nature of a violently flaming, dark red cosmic 
      volcano billowing masses of fire. [225]&nbsp; Sum is emitted, appearing as dark 
      blue light from which emerges a lapis-lazuli-colored ground, clear as 
      crystal. Beneath it a kila-shaped mountain appears without obscuration. 
      Outside is a blazing expanse of a roaring mass of fire of </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 152 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">primordial wisdom, 
      resounding like the conflagration at the end of the eon. Within that 
      expanse a bhrum emerges, transforming into a ferocious palace with its 
      exterior composed of various precious substances, its interior composed of 
      three types of skulls, with dry skulls forming the ceiling, old skulls 
      with dry flesh and skin forming the edges of the ceiling, and fresh&nbsp; 
      skulls dripping with blood forming the walls. Those are all held in place 
      with nails of meteorite. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The ceiling symbolizes 
      the dharmakaya, the edges of the ceiling symbolize the sambhogakaya, and 
      the walls symbolize the nirmanakaya. The meteorite nails are symbols of 
      the ultimate Spirit of Awakening. The roof is made of human skin upon 
      which victory banners of human corpses are hoisted. The bases of the 
      pillars are the eight great nagas, the pillars are the eight great devas, 
      the tops of the pillars are the eight great planets, the directional 
      guardians and bhimas are the criss-crossing beams, the constellations are 
      displayed as the ceiling beams, and above, below, and in all directions 
      blood slowly drips from ornamental strings of heads of large and small 
      rudras. [226] The entire surroundings are covered with human corpses and 
      the corpses of horses emerging from bubbles in a swirling ocean of blood. 
      The entire environment outside roars with a violent, fiery wind, like a 
      hail storm, and countless substances of black magic, weapons, and their 
      wielders, with the naturally emitted sounds of ferocious mantras such as 
      hum hum phat phat bellowing forth like a thousand rolls of thunder. 
      Everywhere outside of that are many spontaneously present, confounding 
      mandalas of wrathful male and female beings, including the eight great 
      charnel grounds, the ten abodes of Heruka, and the twenty-four sites. 
      There all the guardians of the doctrine, Dharma protectors, local 
      guardians, and treasure-masters devour for their food the warm flesh and 
      blood of the malevolent enemies of the doctrine; and as for their tasks, 
      they take away the breath of life of the ten fields, and they guard the 
      doctrine of the Buddha. They proudly display terrifying forms and&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page153</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">emit sounds of killing 
      and dismembering. Brandishing sharp weapons and rough instruments, they 
      display beautiful apparitions and take wrathful delight in acts of 
      killing. With their minds unmoved from the peaceful state of 
      reality-itself, they serve the needs of animate beings by subduing others 
      with compassion. All of them are none other than emanations of the great 
      universal splendor. [227] In short, all these myriads of haughty , 
      terrifying beings surround the palace, without any space between them, in 
      the manner of kings, ministers, and the general populace. Imagine that 
      they are encircled outside by nine concentric wheels of protection.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In the center of that 
      terrifying, ferocious palace is an eight-spoked wheel of meteorite, 
      symbolizing the purification of the eight objects of consciousness. In its 
      center are eight kings of beasts, symbolizing the purification of the 
      eight collections of consciousness, supporting a vast, lofty throne of 
      precious substances, symbolizing utter transcendence beyond mundane 
      existence. Upon it is a lotus, symbolizing the great center, emptiness, 
      and detachment towards the cycle of existence; a moon symbolizing the 
      skillful means of great bliss, the element of the white bindu, and the 
      lack of contamination by the flaws of the cycle of existence; a sun 
      symbolizing the wisdom of great emptiness, the element of red rakta, and 
      the perfection of all excellent qualities; and a seat of male and female 
      corpses symbolizing the dissolution of self-concepts into the absolute 
      nature and the equality of nonconceptuality. From the absolute nature a 
      blue- black syllable hum descends upon that seat. Emanating rays of light 
      upwards, immeasurable, pleasing offerings are made to all the jinas and 
      jinaputras of the three times. Arousing their mind-streams, [228] all the 
      empowerments and blessings of the circles of ornaments of all their 
      inexhaustible bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and enlightened activities 
      are drawn in like a convergence of masses of light and rainbow clouds; and 
      they dissolve into the hum. Then rays of</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 154 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">light are emitted 
      downwards, utterly purifying all the vices, obscurations, habitual 
      propensities, karma, mental afflictions, and suffering of all sentient 
      beings in the three realms. Like vigorously arousing them from sleep, they 
      are liberated into the absolute nature in which delusion is unknown. At 
      the same time as the rays of light are retracted, imagine that all the 
      life-force, merit, radiance, and splendor of all sentient beings, as well 
      as the vital essence of the four elements and all glorious qualities, 
      converge in the form of a five-colored mass of light and dissolve into the 
      hum.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The syllable hum 
      transforms into awareness as the causal Heruka, whose body is blue-black 
      in color, holding a vajra in his right hand and a skull filled with blood 
      in his left. His naked body, devoid of clothing and ornaments, stands in 
      an expanse of a blazing mass of fire of primordial wisdom, with his two 
      legs positioned in a wrathful posture. From the three points of his body 
      rays of light are emitted and then draw in every single one of the 
      mandalas of the three embodiments of the jinas in the form of white, red, 
      and deep blue rays of light. Imagine that they dissolve into your own 
      three points, generating great power and strength. [229]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In an instant you then 
      transform into the great universal splendor, and the supreme basis of 
      emanation of all wrathful beings--Heruka--the blue-black color of his body 
      symbolizing the immutable, absolute nature of reality, free of conceptual 
      elaboration. His blue-black, central face symbolizes the dharmakaya, the 
      empty , originally pure, essential nature; his white, right face 
      symbolizes the sambhogakaya, the clear, spontaneously present nature; and 
      his flaming, dark red, left face symbolizes the nirmanakaya, all-pervasive 
      compassion. His central eye is a symbol of the primordial wisdom of 
      emptiness; his right eye is a symbol of the primordial wisdom of clarity; 
      and his left eye is a symbol of all-pervasive primordial wisdom. His two 
      ears symbolize the two truths. His nose&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">symbolizes the two 
      goals. His frown symbolizes all the paths and fruitions. His mouth 
      symbolizes the great bliss of equality. His tongue symbolizes liberation 
      in the equality of samsara and nirvana. The rows of his teeth, white like 
      snow mountains, symbolize the mandala of the absolute nature of the 
      blood-drinking vajra. His four, bared fangs symbolize the subduing of 
      animate beings by means of the Four Immeasurables. His orange hair flaming 
      upwards symbolizes the primordial absence of delusion. His eyebrows 
      flashing like a thousand bolts of lightning symbolize the elimination of 
      the realm of darkness of ignorance and the manifestation of the 
      illumination of primordial wisdom. [230] His flaming mustache and beard, 
      emitting fiery sparks, symbolize the blazing of the great creative 
      expressions of the primordial wisdom of bliss and emptiness. His six arms 
      symbolize the six syllables, and his first right hand holds a nine-pointed 
      vajra symbolizing the sequence of nine yanas and the nine grounds; his 
      middle right hand holds a five-pointed vajra symbolizing the five 
      embodiments and the five primordial wisdoms; and his bottom right hand 
      holds a three-pointed vajra symbolizing the three embodiments and the 
      three primordial wisdoms. His first left hand holds a dry bhandha filled 
      with blood, symbolizing the cycle of existence of the formless realm 
      displayed as blood; the middle left hand holds a bhandha covered with 
      blood and skin, filled with blood and symbolizing the cycle of existence 
      of the form realm displayed as blood; and his bottom left hand holds a 
      bhandha with braided hair, filled with blood and symbolizing the cycle of 
      existence of the desire realm displayed as blood. His four legs are 
      wrathfully spread wide apart, symbolizing his possession of the four 
      foundations of supernormal abilities. The wings of the garuda, flaming 
      with vajra jewels, are outstretched to his right and left, symbolizing his 
      victory over the three realms and his venturing without impediment into 
      the absolute nature of reality-itself. He has a charnel ground and all 
      glorious apparel symbolizing the arising of the </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 156 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">objects of 
      consciousness as ornaments. He stands [231] amidst a blazing mass of fire 
      like the cosmic conflagration at the end of the eon, symbolizing the 
      incineration of the false conceptions of ignorance by great, primordial 
      wisdom. Above him hovers a black garuda symbolizing delusion displaying 
      itself as wisdom. Samantabhadra and his consort reside on his crown as the 
      Lords of buddha classes, symbolizing his never wavering from the state of 
      peace of the dharmakaya. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The universal splendor 
      arises as the display of Heruka symbolizing the skillful means of great 
      bliss, and he embraces the pale blue body of his consort Akasamukhi, who 
      symbolizes the wisdom of great emptiness. Her right hand holds a khatranka 
      that cuts off the three poisons, and her left hand holds a skull filled 
      with blood, which bestows the three realms as blood. Her left leg embraces 
      the waist of her consort, symbolizing the union of bliss and emptiness, 
      and her right leg presses on the heart of a corpse, symbolizing the 
      closing of the door on the cycle of existence of the three realms. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As a sign of lust 
      arising as an ornament, she wears, an upper garment of human skin; as a 
      sign of hatred arising as an ornament, she is adorned with garlands of 
      snakes and human heads; as a sign of delusion arising as an ornament, she 
      wears a moist leopard skin as a lower garment; as a sign of holding the 
      three worlds with compassion, strands of her dark red hair flow down her 
      back. His vajra enters the womb of her lotus, symbolizing the union of 
      bliss and emptiness. [232] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The natural luster of 
      mirror-like primordial wisdom arises as the white hatred-vajra in the 
      east; the natural luster of the primordial wisdom of equality arises as 
      the yellow pride-vajra in the south; the natural luster of the primordial 
      wisdom of discernment arises as the red attachment-vajra in the west; and 
      the </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page157 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">natural luster of the 
      primordial wisdom of accomplishment arises as the dark green pride-vajra 
      in the north. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">On the crown of the 
      majestic chosen deities imagine a thousand-spoked wheel of Dharma. At its 
      center is a white om, white and radiant like an autumnal moon. At their 
      throats is an eight-petalled lotus, at the center of which is a red 
      syllable ah, more radiant than a hundred thousand suns. At their hearts is 
      an erect, nine-pointed, meteorite vajra, at the center of which is a 
      sun-seat. On that is a blue-black syllable hum, radiant like a 
      lapis-lazuli mountain drenched in the light of a hundred thousand suns. 
      From those syllables are emitted white, red, and deep blue rays of light, 
      arousing the mind-streams of all the jinas and jinaputras of the ten 
      directions and the four times. From the absolute nature of reality 
      rupakayas emerge in the forms of the five classes of sugatas. They are 
      invited into the space in front, and they empower you with the vase water, 
      filling your body from the crown of your head. All the stains of 
      afflictive and cognitive obscurations are totally purified, and the vajra-essences 
      enter their three points, [233] sealing them with the three vajras. You 
      are appointed as the regent of the jinas and empowered to liberate the 
      whole cycle of existence of the three realms. The excess water spills 
      over, crowning your head with the five classes of buddhas who abide as the 
      principle lords of the buddha classes. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again the essential 
      nature of nondual emptiness and bliss of the deities, in the form of a 
      white and red mass of light, dissolves into yourself, and imagine that 
      this brings forth the power and strength to dominate' the whole of samsara 
      and nirvana. White, red, and deep blue rays of light are emitted from your 
      own three points, inviting from the domain of the space-treasury of 
      reality-itself all the jinas and jinaputras of the four times and the ten 
      directions, displayed as the foundational mandala and the beings who 
      reside in it. Converging upon you like a blizzard, repeatedly imagine that 
      they nondually dissolve into you and your</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">implements of practice 
      like snow falling into a great lake. Invite them in that way. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then they proceed into 
      the sky above you and the mandala where all the jinas are offered seats in 
      accordance with their own minds.44 As soon as the seats are offered, the 
      deities dissolve into those in front of you, and imagine that they each 
      sit on their own seats. In that way request them to remain. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">From all the places 
      where you have visualized yourself as your chosen deities [234] corporeal 
      beings are emanated, equal in number to the atoms of the earth. They bow 
      before the deities, and between their two, pressed palms are precious 
      jewels from which are emitted myriads of clouds of offerings. By making 
      immeasurable offerings to please their bodies, speech, minds, qualities, 
      and enlightened activities, their mind-streams are pleased and satisfied. 
      Immeasurable rays of light are emitted from their bodies, utterly 
      purifying all vices and obscurations, and transforming everyone into 
      displays of the chosen deities. Imagine that they dissolve into your own 
      heart as the imagined deity, bringing forth majestic power. That is the 
      homage. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The offering water 
      cools their bodies; the water for bathing the feet cools their feet; 
      flowers are offered at their seats; incense pervades the area with a 
      fragrant aroma; clear illumination removes the obscurations so that the 
      objects of the mind are limpid and clear; fragrantly scented water 
      pervades all their accouterments and their bodies; and various foods 
      satisfy their gustatory faculties; the sounds of various kinds of lovely 
      music are offered, which satisfy their minds with the taste of bliss and 
      emptiness. Beautiful, satisfying goddesses of form make offerings pleasing 
      to the eyes, and they dissolve into their visual faculties; [235] 
      goddesses of sound bearing lovely sounds make offerings pleasing to the 
      ear, and they dissolve into their audial faculties; goddesses of</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">44 That is, seats 
      symbolic of ferocity are offered to wrathful deities, peaceful seats are 
      offered to peaceful deities, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">smell bearing 
      delicious fragrances make offerings pleasing to the nose, and they 
      dissolve into their olfactory faculties; goddesses of taste bearing 
      various foods make offerings pleasing to the tongue, and they dissolve 
      into their gustatory faculties; goddesses of touch bearing garments make 
      offerings pleasing to the deities' bodies, and they dissolve into their 
      tactile faculties satisfying their minds with the taste of bliss and 
      emptiness. Those visualizations are the outer and inner offerings. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The five poisons are 
      transformed into the ambrosia of primordial wisdom and are offered; the 
      animate and inanimate universe is transformed into displays of tormas and 
      is offered; the cycle of existence is transformed into an ocean of blood 
      and is offered; appearances and emptiness-the union of the deity and 
      consort-are offered as the uncontaminated, great bliss of union; and the 
      vajra of skillful means-the primordial being of reality-itself-delivers 
      the rudras of self concepts of the three realms into the domain of the 
      wisdom of identitylessness, and ordinary appearances of objects are 
      transformed into mountains of flesh, oceans of blood, and piles of bones, 
      and are offered. Thus, all appearances of phenomena are destroyed in 
      great, intellect-transcending reality-itself; and that is the offering of 
      deliverance. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again [236] mentally 
      visualize all the colors of the bodies, hand-symbols, ornaments, and 
      garments of all the deities of the mandala, and as you recall their great 
      qualities, imagine that you project from your body innumerable viras and 
      dakinis who perform beautiful dances in the sky, sound various musical 
      instruments held in their hands, and make offerings of lovely songs of 
      praise. That is the visualization of praise. Such meditation simply 
      involving visualized imagery is indispensable. Practicing without even 
      that is no more meaningful than the chirping of birds, and no siddhis will 
      arise, just as no butter emerges from churning water.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In terms of ultimate 
      reality, by establishing the meaning of emptiness, all appearances and 
      mental states of the cycle of existence are transformed into the best, 
      unsurpassed method of identifying the self-nature of Samantabhadra, the 
      supreme deity who dwells as the ground, the nature of emptiness. In terms 
      of conventional reality, the method is to meditate on and visualize one's 
      body, speech, and mind as the three vajras.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In the past, due to 
      the obscuration of the habitual propensities of karma and mental 
      afflictions, the deity who dwells as the ground has not manifested, but 
      has been reduced to a vacuity that is an ethically neutral immateriality. 
      Now by manifesting the faculty of wisdom that realizes identitylessness, 
      [237] primordial wisdom free of grasping onto clarity and emptiness 
      becomes manifest, and that is ultimate reality. Visualizing the 
      samayasattvas as if they were tangible, inviting the primordial wisdom 
      deities from the absolute nature, and merging them indivisibly is 
      conventional reality. Inviting them from one place to another is something 
      that is not established in reality; rather it is merely posited by the 
      intellect as existing. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Identifying awareness 
      that is present as the ground, dharmakaya, and stabilizing that in one's 
      mind-stream is ultimate; imagining the deities as remaining due to 
      requesting them to sit on their prepared seats is conventional. Delight 
      due to one's belief in the manifestations of the displays of 
      self-appearing, primordial wisdom is called the homage of encountering the 
      view. In that the one making homage and all the many objects of homage are 
      of one taste; they are not different, and that is ultimate. 
      Conventionally, in accordance with the ways of the cycle of existence, one 
      makes reverent homage according to the custom of showing reverent homage 
      to kings and so on; and that is conventional. When one sees the mode of 
      existence of the Great Perfection, reality-itself, one knows that all 
      sensory objects that appear in the world are not prepared, but are self&nbsp;

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">arising offerings; and 
      that is ultimate. illusory prepared substances, illusion-like increasing 
      mantras, [238] illusory visualizations, and the projections of illusion 
      like, attractive objects to the senses of appearances of deities, who are 
      like the audience, are conventional offerings. The wondrous perception of 
      the nature and qualities of the reality that is present as the ground-dharmakaya 
      is ultimate; praising the great qualities of the deities in the manner of 
      praising and extolling great people such as kings is conventional. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Knowing that in 
      reality the ground dharmakaya is totally present in oneself is the 
      essential nature of the view of the Great Perfection, so recognize that 
      attending single-pointedly to the manifest nature of awareness is of the 
      utmost importance.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">When you visualize the 
      deity in that way, stabilize your pride with the knowledge that you are 
      the deity. Previously when you were wandering in the cycle of existence, 
      the latent consciousness that grasped onto the appearance of sentient 
      beings' bodies as yourself was pride. As the agent of all appearances&nbsp; and 
      mental states, visualize your own body as a deity in that manner. The 
      unceasing consciousness itself that grasps onto the appearance of sentient 
      beings' bodies as I is exchanged for the consciousness of the deity. 
      Practicing with the unceasing consciousness of yourself as the deity is 
      called the stabilization of divine pride and divine samadhi. In doing this 
      practice, if you disengage from this crucial point of transferring your 
      self-appearance to that of the deity, [239] no matter how you practice, 
      the deity will not be actualized.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you achieve 
      stability in divine pride in this way, finally when you identify 
      awareness, you will have already achieved stability in awareness for 
      yourself; so that will propel you towards the state of liberation. 
      Training in bringing forth clear appearances by vividly imagining the 
      color of the deity's body, together with the hand-symbols, ornaments, and 
      garments, is to make </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">them manifest, just as 
      the appearances of your own aggregates, elements, and sense-bases appear 
      clearly and firmly due to conceptual projections. By visualizing the 
      divine field and the deities themselves again and again and nurturing 
      that, the ground of firm pride is maintained. Know that to be of the 
      utmost importance for actualizing the deity. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">From the primordial 
      protector, the dharmakaya, down to all the maras and rudras, not a single 
      being exists as anything other than your own appearances. Fathoming that 
      with certainty is the way to avoid the error of reifying the stage of 
      generation, and it is a special, profound point for actualizing the deity 
      as primordial wisdom. For yogins who realize that samsara and nirvana are 
      none other than their own appearances, even if they practice meditating on 
      pisacas, raksasas, and [240] and theurangs, those are seen to be nothing 
      other than emanations of Samantabhadra. So apart from primordial wisdom 
      beings, there is not a single mundane being among them; for they are all 
      enlightened displays of Samantabhadra. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Without realizing 
      that, those who grasp onto themselves as themselves, onto others and 
      others, onto deities as deities, and onto demons as demons will err by 
      becoming gods of the form realm if they meditate on peaceful deities; and 
      if they meditate on wrathful ones, they will become maras and raksasas. 
      Even if they meditate on primordial wisdom beings, they will definitely 
      remain as mundane beings. Why? Due to the power of ignorance they are 
      deluded with respect to dualistic grasping; for ignorance refers to 
      ignorance of the mode of being of the ground. Knowledge refers to 
      awareness of the mode of being of the ground. Due to the power of 
      ignorance, all the deities on which one meditates are actualized as 
      sentient beings, so they are only mundane. Due to the power of knowledge, 
      all the deities on which one meditates are actualized as primordial 
      wisdom. By realizing that the whole of samsara and nirvana consists&nbsp;&nbsp;

      beings, without even an iota of any mundane being.45 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At the hearts of the 
      deities visualized in that way imagine a jnanasattva on a lotus and sun 
      seat, at whose heart is a sun. [241] Upon that is a nine-pointed, 
      meteorite vajra standing upright. At its center is a blue-black hum, the 
      color of lapis-lazuli, in the center of an enclosing sun and moon, with a 
      mantra-string encircling it. Direct your consciousness to the hum and 
      recite; and direct your consciousness to the bindu and nada of the hum and 
      recite. That is called propitiating the deity. Imagine that the mantras 
      rise above the seat and encircle it, and recite. That is called close 
      propitiation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At that time vast rays 
      of light emanate forth, inviting the entire assembly of all the victorious 
      buddhas, bodhisattvas, gurus, chosen deities, viras and dakinis of the ten 
      directions without exception. Imagine again and again that they dissolve 
      into the beings in front of you, and recite. Direct your consciousness to 
      all the deities, and recite. Direct your consciousness to the circular 
      mantras at their hearts and recite. Alternately direct your consciousness 
      to the hum on the crescent moon, the bindu, and nada. Like sending forth 
      messengers of the king, the crucial aspects of propitiation are inviting 
      all the jinas and jinaputras with rays of light, having them repeatedly 
      dissolve, and supplicating the deities. </font></p>

      obscurations, karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities in the 
      mind-streams of all sentient beings in the three realms. Then all 
      appearances are transformed into the nature of buddha-fields and palaces, 
      and all mundane beings are transformed into the nature of male and female 
      deities. With one voice and with the one taste of their minds they chant 
      in majestic union the sounds of mantras, like the sound of a beehive when 
      it is being destroyed. As a result, imagine that all the realms of the 
      universe shake and tremble. That is a great practice. </font></p>

      from the mantra-strings in the hearts of the beings in front of you, 
      making&nbsp; offerings pleasing to all the jinas and jinaputras, and arousing 
      their mind-streams. All the empowerments, blessings, siddhis, primordial 
      wisdoms, and qualities of the circles of ornaments of their inexhaustible 
      bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and enlightened activities are gathered 
      back in the form of a white mass of light, which dissolves into yourself

      all the empowerments, siddhis, and powers of pacification. Again an 
      immeasurable mass of white light is emanated to the abodes of the six 
      classes of animate beings, totally purifying all the vices, obscurations, 
      habitual propensities, karma, mental afflictions, and suffering of all 
      sentient beings in the three realms; and imagine that they all become

      and merit of all sentient beings in the three realms, all the 
      empowerments, blessings, and siddhis of the bodies, speech, minds,

      ten directions and the four times in the form of red light. This dissolves 
      into yourself, and subjugates all the gods, demons, humans, all male and 
      female humans, and every single one of the eight classes of haughty 
      non-human beings. They are brought in front of you, where all the mighty 
      power of all these terribly ferocious beings is overwhelmed. Then imagine 
      that the vitality in their hearts is coughed up from their mouths as they 
      solemnly swear to be your servants and slaves; and they dissolve into the 
      soles of your feet. Again rays of dark red light are emitted from the 
      hearts of the beings in front of you, placing a half vajra on the tops of 
      the heads of all those haughty beings,&nbsp; signifying that they must not 
      transgress their pledge. If they abide by their oath, and engage in 
      enlightened activities, this will protect them from danger, and become a 
      crown-jewel for all their needs and desires. If they transgress their word 
      and oath, it will turn into a meteorite lightning bolt [245] that will

      violent hail storm, expelling and dismembering all malevolent material and 
      immaterial enemies and malevolent beings, like water extinguishing sparks 
      of fire. Then innumerable small wrathful beings, iron scorpions, and 
      garudas are emanated, totally devouring the mound of their flesh, blood, 
      and bones, incinerating them in a blazing ball of fire, and dispersing 
      them with a razor-wind, such that not even a trace of them remains. Then 
      imagining that their consciousnesses are delivered to a realm in which 
      delusion is unknown is the visualization of ferocity. </font></p>

      enlightened activities of all the jinas and jinaputras of the three times; 
      and&nbsp; repeatedly visualize that dissolving into yourself and your 
      implements of practice. Then immeasurable rays of light emanate from [246] 
      your heart, striking the hearts of the jinas and jinaputras. All the jinas 
      are connected to you with a strand of light rays, and all the 
      nonconceptual, primordial wisdoms in their mind-streams are transferred to 
      your own mind-stream. Without letting your consciousness be distracted 
      elsewhere, recite the mantras without interrupting them with human words; 
      and diligently apply yourself to practice without letting your meditation 
      cushion grow cold. </font></p>

      Mahayoga. Stabilizing them in the ultimate nature of awareness is 
      propitiation, and enhancing them by means of one's conduct is practice; 
      and that is the essential nature of the contemplative practice. Training 
      in mentally visualizing in that manner is called conventional and 
      provisional. Skill in the transformations of emitting and withdrawing rays 
      of light is the most important, quintessential point of the practice, so 
      hold onto that as the most crucial thing to know. </font></p>

      the nonconceptual, primordial wisdom of reality-itself, is the wisdom 
      empowerment. Mastering the fruition in oneself is called the word 
      empowerment. Those are the real four empowerments, devoid of a bestower 
      and a recipient. </font></p>

      empowerment; and the realization of the nonduality of deity and your own

      obscure the self-nature of the ground. In reality, not even the slightest

      what method could there be for confessing them? Determining the meaning of 
      the two kinds of identitylessness, [248] then realizing the mode of 
      existence of the ground is called confession and purification. As a 
      substitute for that, confession with one's mind, confession with material 
      goods, and confession by uttering words are methods for averting obstacles

      A single syllable ram is emitted from your heart as your chosen deity.

      the buddhas, bodhisattvas, gurus, chosen deities, dakinis, and guardians 
      draw the vital essence of the ambrosia through the vajra tubes of their 
      tongues. As they experience it, imagine that their minds are satisfied

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">With respect to the 
      practice of deliverance, the proper realization that the entire universe 
      of samsara and nirvana is none other than one's own appearances is called 
      the great fortress of the view. Not wavering from the manifestation of the 
      nature of the ground is called the great highway of meditation. The 
      so-called vitality of the visualization entails visualizing these 
      external, inanimate worlds in such a way that is impossible for enemies 
      and malevolent beings to survive once this visualization simply descends 
      upon the nature of their life force, life, and vitality. That 
      visualization is critical for not missing one's target. Diligent attention 
      to the </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 171 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">task of delivering up 
      one's enemies by visualizing all the inner inhabitants of the universe as 
      being perfected in the body, speech, mind, qualities, and enlightened 
      activities of your chosen deity [252] is critical for preventing one's 
      deed from turning back on oneself. Visualizing oneself as the great 
      splendor, not being parted from the pride of one's chosen deity, and 
      directly visualizing the supreme son kila, is a special, profound point 
      for not being conquered. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In particular, simply 
      due to directly visualizing effigies of one's enemies placed inside a 
      drubkung--the black slaughterhouse of the Yama of Karma shaken by the din 
      of the five poisons--like bugs who have fallen into a fire, there is no 
      escape for them. For example, the ritual for bringing someone back from 
      beyond the grave, and the means of deliverance by way of the transmissions 
      on the enemy's life-force, purification, and abode entail different 
      techniques, but they are similar in their meaning. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the method of 
      trapping someone in a drub kung, visualize in front of you a celestial 
      mansion with no doors or seams and with no way to escape anywhere else 
      than out the top. Inside that, instead of an effigy place a drawing of a 
      person with joined palms. That direct meditation and the one for those who 
      have departed from this life are similar. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">To summon your 
      enemies, while imagining yourself as your chosen deity, emanate from your 
      heart countless messengers carrying; hooks, nooses, iron chains, and bells 
      [253], sent forth like a violent, black wind that destroys the cosmos. As 
      a result, imagine that the life, life force, and vitality of your enemies 
      and malevolent beings are irresistibly&nbsp; drawn in and become nondual with 
      that effigy, like one body of water merging into another.&nbsp; Moreover, the 
      consciousness of the one who has departed is drawn in, like a fish on a 
      hook, by light rays from the heart of the being in front of you47 and 
      dissolves repeatedly </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">47 As your generate 
      yourself as your chosen deity, so do you imagine your chosen deity in the 
      space in front of you.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 172 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">into the drawing of 
      that person. Those two techniques are similar. Repeatedly imagine that the 
      entire life force, life, and vitality of your enemy converge--like iron 
      filings attracted by a magnet--in the form of the syllable nri on the tip 
      of a kila and dissolve into the intervening space between the sun and the 
      moon of the seat of yourself as your chosen deity. Alternatively, imagine 
      that they are drawn up from the hole in the kila and dissolve into the 
      hearts of the Heruka and consort dwelling in its bulbous handle, thereby 
      increasing their power and might. That is the transmission on the 
      [enemies'] life. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In a similar way, as 
      for the six destinations of one who has passed away, you may bring forth 
      the appearances of the six destinations in the forms of the six 
      seed-syllables of the six classes of living beings. Then, from the 
      seed-syllable at your heart, as your chosen deity, emanate rays of red 
      light, thereby gradually incinerating [254] and transforming those 
      appearances. That is called the transmission on the life of the six 
      classes.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ultimately, to 
      manifest the primordial wisdom of awareness is to restore your own being. 
      To represent that, emanate countless hum syllables from your heart as you 
      visualize yourself as your chosen deity, completely filling the entire 
      domain of samsara and nirvana. All the buddhas and buddha-fields, together 
      with the animate and inanimate three realms dissolve into the hum 
      syllables like salt dissolving into water or camphor dispersing into the 
      air. Drawing them all back in, they dissolve into yourself such that you 
      become the great, universal splendor of the whole of samsara and nirvana. 
      That meditation constitutes the restoration of your being. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The restoration of the 
      kila ultimately refers to the manifestation of the great wisdom of 
      realizing identitylessness and apprehending its inner depths for yourself. 
      To represent that, in terms of conventional truth directly visualize the 
      &quot;supreme son&quot; kila and emanate from it kila replicas, like sparks emerging 
      from a </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 173 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">fire. They completely 
      fill the whole of samsara and nirvana, and, like before, all phenomena of 
      the two kinds are drawn back in and merge into the visualized supreme son 
      kila, like salt dissolving into water. As a result, all the might, power, 
      and strength of the whole of samsara and nirvana is drawn in and 
      perfected. That visualization is the conventional path. [2551 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the restoration 
      of the rudra, ultimately all the animate and inanimate three realms are 
      none other than the outer, inner, and secret rudras48 themselves, but that 
      is obscured due to the influence of ignorance. That is to be established 
      by means of investigation with great wisdom, and is to be realized as it 
      is in reality. To represent that, directly visualize an effigy as your 
      actual enemies and malevolent beings. From it black light is emanated, and 
      the life force, life, vitality , merit, and possessions of all your 
      enemies and malevolent beings are drawn in and merge with the light, like 
      a water drop touched with the tip of a red-hot spike. Imagine them 
      dissolving into the effigy. The three kinds of restoration are 
      indispensable. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then as for the actual 
      deliverance, just by agitating the aggregates, elements, and sense-bases 
      of your enemy with the tip of the blade of the kila like butter emerging 
      from milk--the essential nature of the enemy's vitality turns into a 
      shimmering, white syllable nri. That is completely drawn inside the tip of 
      the kila--like sucking up a water drop--and it dissolves into the kila. 
      Imagine that the kila is filled to the brim, like a sack filled with 
      yogurt. Again, with the mere agitation of his aggregates, elements, and 
      sense-bases, the essential nature of his life and merit turns into a 
      shimmering green nri. [256] That is completely drawn into the tip of the 
      kila, and all his taints and faults are purified through the kila's 
      aperture. Imagine that [his consciousness] emerges from the crown of his 
      head and dissolves into yourself. Again imagine rays of</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">48 Here the term rudra 
      refers to conceptual grasping by which one reifies the distinctions of 
      outer, inner, and secret phenomena.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 174 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">white light emanating 
      from the tip of the kila, utterly purifying all the vices, obscurations, 
      karma, and mental afflictions of your enemies and malevolent beings. That 
      visualization is called the transmission on purification. In a similar 
      fashion, with the vase-water, the ambrosia of blessings of the deities of 
      the mandala, one gradually, completely purifies all the karma, mental 
      afflictions, and habitual propensities that are the seeds giving rise to 
      rebirth among the six classes of sentient beings. That, too, is called the 
      transmission on purification. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At the time of actual 
      deliverance, when the kila strikes the hearts of your enemies and 
      malevolent beings, their consciousness turns into a white bindu marked 
      with the syllable a, and--as if it were being sucked up through a 
      straw--it is drawn up through the aperture in the kila. Then all their 
      afflictive and cognitive obscurations are completely purified, like 
      removing stains from a white crystal. From the lower globe of the kila the 
      enlightened awareness of the nirmanakaya is transferred to their 
      mind-streams; from its bulbous handle the enlightened awareness of the 
      sambhogakaya is transferred to their mind-streams, and from its upper 
      globe the enlightened awareness of the dharmakaya is transferred to their 
      mind-streams. They dissolve into the heart of the deity generated in front 
      of you, such that they become Awakened in the expanse of the enlightened 
      awareness of the four embodiments [257] and the five primordial wisdoms. 
      That visualization, in which they are elevated from their own abode is the 
      technique of the transmission on the [enemies'] abode.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In a similar fashion, 
      to lead the dead from their abodes, all the appearances of the six classes 
      of sentient beings, the miserable abodes that arise in just an instant, 
      and all the habitual propensities, karma, and mental afflictions of the 
      cycle of existence are utterly purified, like roughly arousing someone 
      from sleep. Then the appearances of a nirmanakaya-field emerge, and with 
      the first phat, the enlightened awareness of the nirmanakaya is 
      transferred; with the&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 175 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">second, the 
      enlightened awareness of the sambhogakaya is transferred; and with the 
      third, the enlightened awareness of the dharmakaya is transferred. As a 
      result, the appearances of a pristine buddha-field come in full measure. 
      The meditation of recognizing [awareness], achieving confidence, 
      perfecting one's strength, and achieving stability is called the technique 
      of the transmission on the abode. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Finally, all the 
      aggregates, elements, and sense-basis of your enemies and malevolent 
      beings turn into the form of flesh and blood. This is offered to the mouth 
      of your chosen deity, thereby gathering the remains of the cycle of 
      existence into the absolute nature. The aggregates, elements, and 
      sense-bases of the dead remain in the form of an inscription,49 which is 
      incinerated in the flames of primordial wisdom. Consequently, the residue 
      of the cycle of existence converges into the five primordial wisdoms. 
      Thus, that technique is similar to the preceding.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If the one who is 
      visualized in that way is alive, once he is delivered, all the actions to 
      lead him will definitely succeed. [258] If one lacks the three requisites 
      of the fortress, highway, and the vitality, whatever ferocious activities 
      one performs, they will be like children's games and one's goals will not 
      be accomplished. Ultimately, in the great drub kung of emptiness, the 
      wisdom of realizing identitylessness, like a sharp weapon, delivers the 
      rudra of dualistic grasping onto the animate and inanimate universe into 
      nonobjective identitylessness. Then the manifested primordial wisdom of 
      awareness is aroused as the enlightened awareness of the three 
      embodiments, and one proceeds to the supreme state of liberation, the 
      attainment of perfect buddhahood; and the residue of the cycle of 
      existence is withdrawn into the absolute nature.</font></p>
