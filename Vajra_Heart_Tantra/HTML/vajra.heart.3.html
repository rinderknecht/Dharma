      observing many entities with and without form by means of extrasensory 
      perception.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">After becoming 
      thoroughly familiar with that, any kind of sense of joy or sorrow may 
      trigger a unification of mindfulness and conceptualization. Then, like the 
      knots in a snake unraveling, everything that appears dissolves into the 
      external environment; then everything appears to vanish by itself, 
      resulting in a natural release. Appearances and awareness become 
      simultaneous, so things seem to be released simply upon being known. Thus, 
      arising and release are simultaneous. As soon as things merely arise from 
      their own space, they are released back into their own space, like 
      lightning that flashes from the sky and vanishes back into space. Since 
      this appears by observing within, this is called space-release. All these 
      are in fact the unification and concentration of mindfulness and 
      appearances.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">After all pleasant and 
      unpleasant experiential visions have dissolved into the absolute nature, 
      consciousness rests in its own state of immaculate limpidity. [42] 
      Whatever thoughts and memories arise, do not cling to these experiences, 
      modify them, or judge them, but let them manifest as they roam about in 
      their own dynamic state. The effort of vivid, steady apprehension, as in 
      the case of the conceptualization of enmeshed mindfulness, dissolves by 
      itself. Consequently, the unsatiated mind compulsively strives after 
      mental objects. With a sense of unfulfillment and deficiency, at times you 
      compulsively engage in much cogitation entailing tight concentration and 
      so on. In this phase, consciousness will come to rest in its own state, 
      mindfulness will manifest, and with little clinging to experiences, it 
      will settle into its own natural state free of modification. Thus, you 
      come to naturally settled mindfulness.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The experiential sense 
      of that is soothing and gentle, with clear, limpid consciousness that is 
      neither benefited nor harmed by thoughts; and you </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 27</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">experience a 
      remarkable sense of stillness without needing to modify, reject, or 
      embrace anything. Thus, if you are not counseled by a good spiritual 
      friend at this time, you may think, 'Now there has arisen in my 
      mind-stream an extraordinary, unparalleled view and meditative state that 
      is difficult to fathom and to be shared with no one else.' As time passes 
      while you place your trust and conviction in that, you may discuss it with 
      no one else and delude yourself. [43] When you come to this situation, 
      even if you speak of it to another spiritual friend, unless that person is 
      skilled in speaking and knows how to listen critically, your knowledge of 
      the path will be terribly mistaken. Therefore, if you get stuck there and 
      your life passes by, that error will tie you down so that you will not 
      transcend the realm of mundane existence. So be aware of this! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In particular, a sense 
      of clarity may result in visions of gods and demons,&nbsp; and in your thoughts 
      you may appear to be suddenly assaulted by demons. At times that may be 
      true. But by regarding that as extrasensory perception and repeatedly 
      dwelling on gods and demons, in the end demons will seem to proliferate. 
      Then by conceptually fabricating gods and demons, and proclaiming your 
      extrasensory&nbsp; perception to others, finally you will be practicing demon 
      meditation, and your mind-stream will be possessed by demons. Your vows 
      and samayas will then deteriorate, and you will stray far from Dharma, get 
      lost in mundane activities of this life, and delude yourself in magic 
      rituals. Without even an iota of contentment, you will follow after food 
      and wealth, and your mind will be bound up with clinging, attachment, and 
      craving. While in that state, when you meet with death, you will be reborn 
      as a malevolent demon. By accumulating the causes of experiencing the 
      environment and suffering of a sky-roving preta, your view and meditation 
      go awry , and you become deluded in the endless cycle of existence. [44]&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 28</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">When people of medium 
      and inferior faculties have entered this path, indications of the path 
      will inevitably occur, but if they cling to anything, they will be trapped 
      again by that clinging. Knowing that such experiences are highly 
      misleading and unreliable, leave your awareness in its own state, with no 
      clinging, hopes, fears, rejection, or affirmation. By so doing, those 
      experiences will be naturally released in their own nature, like mist 
      disappearing into the sky. So be aware of that!</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">O Mind Vajra, specific 
      types of good and bad experiences are unpredictable. All techniques from 
      the time of quiescence until conscious awareness becomes manifest are 
      solely means of bringing about experiences, so anything may happen. 
      Therefore, know that ascertaining everything as experiences is a crucial 
      point and the quintessence of practical advice. Then realize that and bear 
      it in mind!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Mahasahasrananta 
      asked, &quot;O Bhagavan, thus if all pleasant and rough experiences are distant 
      from the path to omniscience and are of no benefit, why should we practice 
      meditation? May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Bhagavan replied, 
      &quot;O Mind Vajra, individuals with unrefined, dysfunctional minds agitated by 
      conceptualization [45] enter this path; and by undermining the potency of 
      compulsive ideation, their minds become increasingly steady, and they 
      achieve unwavering stability. On the other hand, even if people identify 
      conscious awareness, but do not practice, they will succumb to the faults 
      of spiritual sloth and distraction. Even if they do practice, due to 
      forgetfulness, they will get lost in endless delusion.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The mind--which is 
      like a cripple--and vital energy--which is like a blind, wild 
      stallion--are disciplined by fastening them with the rope of experiences 
      and grasping. Once people of dull faculties have discerned the mind, they 
      control it with the cords of mindfulness and introspection. By so doing, 
      due to experience</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 29</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">and habituation, they 
      have the sense that all subtle and gross thoughts have vanished. Finally, 
      there arises a state of unstructured consciousness devoid of anything on 
      which to meditate. Then when awareness reaches the state of great 
      non-meditation, the spiritual mentor points that out, so they do not go 
      astray. For those purposes, first one undergoes great struggles in seeking 
      the path, one takes roving thoughts as the path, and finally when 
      consciousness comes upon itself, that is identified as the path. Until the 
      unstructured awareness, or consciousness, of the path manifests and comes 
      upon itself, due to the arousal of one's afflicted mind, [46] one must 
      gradually proceed through rough experiences like those discussed 
      previously.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Bodhisattva 
      Mahasahasrananta asked, &quot;O Bhagavan, are thoughts to be cleaned out or 
      not? If they are, must consciousness arise again after the mind has been 
      purified? May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Teacher replied, 
      &quot;O Mind Vajra, the ties of mindfulness and grasping are dissolved by the 
      power of meditative experiences until finally the ordinary mind of an 
      ordinary sentient being, as it were, disappears. Consequently, compulsive 
      ideation becomes dormant, and roving thoughts vanish into the absolute 
      nature. The vacuous total-ground descends to a state in which the self, 
      others, and objects disappear. One gazes inwards upon clear emptiness with 
      a sense of clinging, and the appearances of self, others, and objects 
      vanish. That is<br>
      the total-ground consciousness. Some teachers explain the descended 
      total-ground as the one taste and as freedom from conceptual elaboration, 
      and others say it is ethically neutral. However it is described, in fact 
      one has come upon the essential nature.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again, a person filled 
      with zeal [47] ascertains that this is not the real path,2 and as a result 
      of meditating, all such emptiness and clear emptiness that</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________<br>
      2Even though one has come upon the essential nature of awareness, if one 
      is complacent with having ascertained that once, that is not the real 
      path, just as taking refuge alone is not sufficient for achieving 
      Buddhahood.&nbsp; Only by continuing in one's meditation practice does all 
      clinging and grasping cease.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 30</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">are imbued with 
      experiential clinging vanish into the absolute nature as if one were 
      waking up. Thereafter, outer appearances are not impeded, and the threads 
      of inner mindfulness and grasping are cut. Then one is not bound by the 
      ties of good meditation, and one does not fall back to an ordinary state 
      due to pernicious ignorance. There is forever-present, limpid, luminous 
      consciousness that transcends the conventions of view, meditation, and, 
      conduct. There is no determination of self and object, such that one can 
      say 'this is consciousness' and 'this is the object of consciousness.' 
      There is freedom from clinging in a primordial, self-arisen state in which 
      the mind has experiences. When you come upon a spaciousness in which there 
      is no cogitation and no attentional referent, all phenomena become 
      manifest, for the power of awareness is unimpeded. Thoughts merge with 
      their objects, they disappear as they become nondual with those objects, 
      and they become disintegrated. Since not even one has an objective 
      referent, they are not thoughts of sentient beings; rather, the mind has 
      been transformed into wisdom; the power of awareness is transformed, and 
      stability is achieved there. Know that this is like water cleared of 
      sediment.&quot; [48]</font></p>

      <a name="The Questions of Prasannatindra">The Questions of Prasannatindra</a></font></u></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Prasannatindra rose from his seat and addressed the Bhagavan, &quot;O Teacher, 
      Bhagavan, may the Omnipresent Lord, the Immutable Sovereign, listen and 
      attend to me. Is the state of primordial, self-arisen liberation achieved 
      solely by cultivating clear awareness that is inconceivable and ineffable, 
      or is it not? If it is, how is it achieved? If it is not, what is the 
      point of cultivating this? What kind of excellent qualities arise? Please 
      explain this for the sake of disciples.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Teacher replied, 
      &quot;O Prasannatindra, you listen and bear this in mind, and I shall truly 
      explain this to you. If the forever-present primordial wisdom of the 
      dharmakaya is not realized even though you have practiced achieving 
      stability in this profound path in the very state of conscious awareness 
      free of conceptual elaboration, as soon as you pass away from this life, 
      there are forces to propel you to the form realm and the formless realm;3 
      but with this alone it is impossible to achieve omniscient buddhahood. 
      Once you have initially identified this path, if the forever-present, 
      primordial wisdom of the dharmakaya is identified due to the power of 
      intense meditation, that is the wisdom of the path and the creative power 
      of primordial wisdom. [49] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">These are the 
      resultant excellent qualities. There is no other space apart from the 
      space inside a pot, and there is no water superior to the water that fills 
      a cup. Likewise, there is no path other than this path of manifest, 
      conscious awareness. Even if you wander down into the impure cycle of 
      existence, that is constructed by the stream of consciousness; and even 
      if, with the virtuous karma of lofty merit, you practice creating deities, 
      meditation, and recitation, that is</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">3The Tibetan reads mu 
      bzhi'i khams, literally translated as &quot;realm of the four alternatives,&quot; 
      instead of the more common gzugs med khams. The &quot;four alternatives&quot; are 
      the four meditative absorptions of the formless realm, namely, infinite 
      consciousness, infinite space, nothingness, and neither-discernment-nor-nondiscernment.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 32</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">accomplished with the 
      stream of consciousness; and even if you practice<br>
      transforming the channels, bindus, and vital energies into displays of the 
      three vajras, it is the stream of consciousness that liberates. Moreover, 
      the manifestation of this alone is the primordially pure ground, which is 
      self-arisen, limpid, clear, nondual, primordial wisdom.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In general, whatever 
      spiritual vehicle you enter, there is no entrance apart from the stream of 
      forever-present primordial wisdom. Furthermore, when ordinary, deluded 
      sentient beings focus on virtue as they chant recitations many times over, 
      that is taught for the sake of the stream of ground-consciousness. 
      Therefore, the stream of consciousness accumulates all karma, so this 
      manifest consciousness itself is unrivaled by any defiled virtue. [50] 
      Moreover, the difference between practicing a mere technique pertaining to 
      the stream of consciousness on the one hand and manifesting consciousness 
      on the other is like that between the sky and the earth. Thus, all 
      extraordinary, excellent qualities are perfected in this manifestation of 
      consciousness. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">O son of good 
      breeding, forever-present, primordial wisdom is the inherently clear light 
      of the minds of sentient beings. It has no referent with respect to all 
      appearances and minds, and the manifestation of this is the outer luster 
      of wisdom. The nature of that manifestation is the inner luster of wisdom. 
      That is very different, like the dawn appearing in the sky. If energetic 
      people of superior faculties apply themselves uninterruptedly and 
      single-pointedly to practice, with no essential diversions, finally the 
      creative power of discerning primordial wisdom will be ignited. As a 
      result, the excellent qualities of the view and meditation of the clear 
      light Great Perfection, which is reality-itself, the very nature of 
      suchness, will truly manifest; and they will become spiritually Awakened 
      as Samantabhadra, the original, primordial ground.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 33</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Even individuals who 
      are not of that sort may identify this crucial point of unstructured, 
      self-arisen consciousness, which manifests without meditation, and they 
      may achieve a little stability in that. All other physical and verbal 
      virtues [51] accumulated throughout a galaxy would not come close to the 
      merit of even one part in a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a 
      hundred thousand of that. Those people would certainly achieve 
      long-lasting stability in the peak of mundane existence.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Bodhisattva 
      Prasannatindra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, may the omnipresent Lord, the 
      Immutable Sovereign listen and attend to me. No matter how much one 
      meditates in that way by taking the mind and consciousness as the path, if 
      that does not result in the fruitional state of liberation or in 
      buddhahood, please show us a method for directly identifying for ourselves 
      the primordially pure Great Perfection, sovereign awareness free of 
      extremes, without having to resort to such a long and difficult path that 
      yields various joys and sorrows but no accomplishment of the fruition. 
      Reveal to us the stages of the path free of hardships, and give us 
      profound, practical instructions to prevent us from falling into error.&quot;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of 
      good breeding, the great, universal ground of all spiritual vehicles is 
      profound emptiness. I shall explain the way to determine the reality of 
      profound emptiness, so listen well! The basis of delusion of all sentient 
      beings of the three realms is [52] ignorance of oneself alone. Examine the 
      basis and root of its origin, location, and departure. To investigate the 
      basis and root of the initial origin of the I: there is a stream of 
      consciousness that grasps onto the fundamental, pervasive, surrounding 
      space as the self. All appearances and mental states are nonexistent and 
      not established except as mere appearances, so their source of origin is 
      empty.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 34</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">To investigate its 
      location where it dwells in the interim: the head is called the head, and 
      it is not given the name I; likewise, hair is hair and not I; the eyes are 
      eyes and not I; the ears are ears and not I; the nose is the nose and not 
      I; the tongue is the tongue and not I; the teeth are teeth and not I; the 
      shoulder-blades are shoulder-blades and not I; the upper arms are upper 
      arms and not I; the lower arms are lower arms and not I; the palms, the 
      back of the hands, and the fingers are not I; the spine is not I; the ribs 
      are not I; the lungs and heart are not I; the liver and its lining are not 
      I; the small intestine, spleen, and kidneys are not I. The thighs, hips, 
      calves, ankles, and all the finger and toe-joints each have their own 
      names, and they are not I. The skin, fat, flesh, blood, lymph, ligaments, 
      tendons, and body hair all have their own names, and they are not 
      established as I. [53]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If the I were to be 
      located in the lower part of the body, there would be no pain if the head 
      and the upper limbs were amputated, so it is not present there. If it were 
      located in the upper body, there would be no pain if lower portions of the 
      body such as the legs were harmed. If it were located inside, there would 
      be no reason why searing pain would be experienced due to the outer body 
      hair and skin being scraped off. Consider whether it is located in the 
      body.&nbsp; When all your clothes, jewelry, food, wealth, and possessions are 
      taken away and used by someone else, misery and intolerable attachment and 
      hostility arise, so it is not located there. Consider whether it is 
      located in external objects. The entire world and its inhabitants would be 
      apprehended as being mine, but in fact all things have their own names, 
      and they are not I. Even if all appearances of the world and its 
      inhabitants apart from the I seem to exist individually, among all dream 
      phenomena, phenomena of this life, and phenomena following this life, the 
      self and all appearances seem to be like the body and its shadow, like

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">liquid and moisture, 
      and like fire and heat. Thus, the I dominates the entire world and its 
      inhabitants, but the I is not located anywhere. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Finally, to 
      investigate and analyze its destination: the entire phenomenal world is 
      the basis and essential nature of the great phantasm of I, so its 
      destination is naturally empty .[54] All the three realms arise from 
      apparitions of grasping onto the I, so it has nowhere else to go. The 
      being who is an agent does not originate and it is located nowhere, so it 
      follows that it disappears.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Prasannatindra 
      asked, &quot;Thus, if it is certain that its origin, location, and destination 
      do not exist and are not established, how do you account for the 
      continuity from one appearance to the next? May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of 
      good breeding, after the consciousness that grasps onto the I has 
      manifested, I and 'mind' emerge from their own space, and they disappear 
      back into their own space. They alternately emerge and withdraw into the 
      vastness of the ethically neutral ground of emptiness. Thus, dream 
      phenomena, phenomena in the waking state, and all the phenomena of the 
      three realms nonexistently arise as mere appearances. Therefore, know that 
      the location of motion, the destination of one who is moving, and the 
      agent are not established.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Bodhisattva 
      Prasannatindra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, when grasping onto the I 
      vanishes into the absolute nature, is its continuum not severed? May the 
      Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of 
      good breeding, even when the appearances and mental states of grasping 
      onto the I vanish into the absolute nature, [55] the ethically neutral 
      ground whose excellent qualities are not manifest acts as the cause of 
      self-grasping. Thus, just that unceasing continuum of the causal ignorance 
      of self-grasping is called the grasping onto the identity of a person.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 36</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Prasannatindra asked, 
      &quot;Teacher, Bhagavan, in what way are external objects empty? May the 
      Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;As for 
      the emergence of grasping onto the identity of apprehended phenomena other 
      than I, let us investigate the way in which all these names, things, and 
      signs are not established. First of all, let us determine the emptiness of 
      the names of the body by investigating the bases of designation of names. 
      To examine that which is called the head: hair is hair and not the head; 
      the eyes are eyes and not the head; the ears are ears and not the head; 
      the nose is the nose and not the head; and the tongue is the tongue and 
      not the head. Likewise, the skin, flesh, bones, blood, lymph, ligaments 
      and so on all appear to have their own names, so they are not established 
      as the head.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Prasannatindra asked, 
      &quot;Teacher, Bhagavan, if you reduce it to its components like that, [56] it 
      is not established, but isn't their configuration called the head?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;Son of 
      good breeding, observe that in general there are many cases in which the 
      assembly of those components is not designated as a head. If one person's 
      head were reduced to particles, which were then assembled and shown to 
      others, they would not call it a head. Even if those particles were 
      moistened and formed into a sphere, that would not be designated as a 
      head. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If your head that 
      appears at the time of a dream, your head that appears during the waking 
      state, your head that appears in the past, and your head that appears in 
      the future were all identical, whatever sores, swellings, goiters, moles, 
      and warts you had would have to appear on all those occasions; but they do 
      not. If each of those heads were different, either all the prior heads 
      would have to be cast off, or else this would indicate the oversight that 
      they were not established from the beginning. If you say it is called the 
      head because it is seen to be on top, you should analyze the upper and 
      lower regions of space. Thus, by </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 37</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">investigating how the 
      front, back, upper, and lower regions of space exist, you will determine 
      that it is not established in any of them.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Likewise, upon what is 
      the eye designated? [57] All fluid spheres are not known by the name of 
      eye. The skin, blood, fat, channels and sinews are not granted the label 
      eye. As in the previous case, the eye does not exist as their assembly 
      either. If you think that a fluid sphere that sees forms is called the 
      eye, observe whether that which sees forms at all times in the past, 
      future, and present, in dream appearances and waking appearances, is this 
      fluid sphere of the present. Self-appearances are due to primordially 
      present consciousness rather than this fluid sphere of the present. Even 
      if you took in hand a hundred million eyeballs facing in one direction, 
      they would not see form. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Likewise, as for the 
      ears, if the flesh, skin, channels, sinews, blood, lymph, and cavities 
      each has its own label and not the appellation of 'ear,' what is called 
      the ear? If you say something is called the ear because it hears sounds, 
      investigate whether that which hears sounds at all times during and after 
      this life, while dreaming and while awake, is the ear. By so doing, you 
      will find that it is the consciousness of the mind that hears and not the 
      form of the present ear. Even if you had in hand countless ears that were 
      listening, they would not hear sounds. This being the case, the ear is 
      primordially not established. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Similarly, by 
      investigating and analyzing the label and real signs of the nose, you find 
      that the flesh, bones, blood, lymph, channels, sinews and cavities all 
      have [58] their own different labels, so they are not established as the 
      nose, nor is it established in their assembly. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you think that that 
      which smells odors is called the nose and that odors are sensed from this 
      orifice, consider that this orifice is not needed in the dream-state nor 
      in other lifetimes. Consciousness in the intermediate state senses odors</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 38</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">as well. Therefore, 
      since mental consciousness has no nose, the nose certainly has no 
      objective existence.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Likewise, the tongue 
      is not established in any of the individual components of the flesh, 
      blood, skin, channels and sinews; nor is the label of tongue established 
      in their assembly. If you assert that this which experiences tastes is the 
      tongue, investigate whether or not it is this very tongue that experiences 
      tastes in the dream-state, the intermediate state, and in other lifetimes; 
      and then you will know.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">By investigating the 
      so-called body in terms of the skin, fat, flesh, blood, marrow, bones, and 
      all the channels and sinews, you will find that the body is not 
      established. If they were all reduced to small and minute particles and 
      then massed together, the label of body would not apply. Even if they were 
      moistened and formed into a lump, that would not be a body. If you say 
      that that which experiences tactile sensations is designated as the body, 
      examine: who is the experiencer of tactile sensations while in a dream and 
      the intermediate state? By so doing, that is determined [59] to be mental 
      consciousness itself. Therefore, since the label of body is not applied to 
      the mind, the body does not exist.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Moreover, upon 
      investigating the locus of the so-called arm, the shoulder is not the arm, 
      nor is the upper arm, the forearm, or the palm and fingers the arm; so I 
      say, 'Identify what the arm is and tell me.' You may say that this which 
      performs the functions of the arm is called the arm. But then, examine 
      whether this is that which appears as an arm and performs the functions of 
      an arm in a dream, and whether it is everything that appears as such in 
      the intermediate state. If you do so, you will find that it is not. 
      Rather, you will determine that they are merely appearances to the mind; 
      so the arm is not established except as something imputed upon the mind.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 39</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Moreover, upon 
      examining the shoulder, the flesh is not the shoulder, nor are the bones, 
      channels, and sinews. It is not established in any of those individual 
      components, and it is not the assembly of the particles to which they can 
      be reduced, even if you were to moisten them and form them into a lump. 
      Likewise, by carefully examining all the joints, it is ascertained that 
      the basis of designation of that label has no objective existence.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Furthermore, upon what 
      do you designate the name for the appearance of a human being over there? 
      The head is not a human. The five sense faculties [60] are not a human. 
      The label of human is not established in flesh, blood, bones, marrow, 
      channels, sinews, major and minor limbs, or consciousness. Likewise, what 
      is the basis of designation of house? Earth is not a house; as for stone, 
      the name for house does not apply to it, only stone itself. The label of 
      house does not apply to the pillars, rafters, beams, or foundation; and 
      even if they were piled together, the label of house would be unwarranted. 
      For example, with respect to a cup, its exterior is not a cup, nor is its 
      interior, its mouth or its base, and wood is not a cup. Neither its 
      individual components nor their assembly exist objectively as its basis of 
      designation. Also in the case of a so-called mountain, earth is not the 
      mountain, nor are stones, grass, or trees; and their assembly is also not 
      a mountain. So the name mountain is empty .</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">To examine the basis 
      of designation of a single stick, its tip is just a tip and not a stick. 
      Its base is nothing other than its base; the wood is nothing other than 
      wood; its burnt ashes are nothing other than ashes; and its ground-up 
      particles are just particles and not a stick. So even that label can only 
      vanish without any objective existence. [61]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Know that earth, 
      water, fire, and air also do not exist in the realm of gross particles, 
      minute particles, or partless minute particles. As for all manner of 
      labels, an illusion is nonexistent and is nothing more than the mere label 
      illusion;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 40</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">a mirage is 
      nonexistent and is nothing more than a mere label; a dream is nonexistent 
      and is nothing more than a mere label; a reflection is nonexistent and is 
      nothing more than a mere label; a city of gandharvas is nonexistent and is 
      nothing more than a mere label; an echo has no objective existence apart 
      from its mere label of echo; the moon in water is nothing more than the 
      mere words the moon in water; a water bubble has no objective existence 
      apart from the mere words water bubble; an optical illusion has no 
      objective existence apart from its mere label; and a magical emanation has 
      no existence apart from the mere utterance of its name. Like the 
      utterances of the sounds of those names, all bases of designation of 
      uttered names and words of all manner of appearing phenomena are 
      nonexistent; and they are emptiness, which is not established. Recognize 
      that emptiness has no objective existence, and emptiness wholly terminates 
      in the expanse of space. That is practical advice.&quot; [62] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Bodhisattva 
      Prasannatindra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, foolish disciples who are 
      bound by clinging onto true existence cannot realize the mode of existence 
      of fundamental reality-itself simply by way of the nonexistence of the 
      basis of designation of a label. Thus, may the Teacher reveal a way to 
      determine its nonexistence by way of gross and subtle inquiry.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Prasannatindra, it is like this: if a tree trunk appears, is the existence 
      of this trunk permanent, or is it utterly nonexistent? This is the 
      investigation and analysis. If it were permanent, it could not be cut or 
      destroyed, and it would have to be truly existent, impermeable, immutable, 
      impenetrable, and imperishable in every way. But a gash occurs when it is 
      chopped with an ax, so it can be cut, and when it is chopped many times, 
      it is felled and destroyed. Since one becomes many, it is deceptive and 
      not truly existent. Since it can be stained with white and black dyes and 
      powders, it is not impermeable but permeable. Since it is subject to 
      change due to the season:; and circumstances, it&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 41</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">is not immutable. It 
      can be penetrated and destroyed anywhere, [63] so it is penetrable, 
      perishable. This wood can be demolished in any number of ways, so it is 
      perishable.&nbsp; As it does not have even one of the qualities of a vajra, it 
      is ascertained to be nonexistent.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Prasannatindra asked, 
      &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, please explain what is a vajra replete with all the 
      seven qualities of a vajra.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Prasannatindra, referring to the existence of a conventional, material 
      vajra is like referring to the son of a barren woman. Material vajras are 
      shown to be made of bone; stone vajras can be destroyed by incinerating 
      them; and iron vajras are melted in fire. They are not truly existent; 
      rather, those conventional vajras are destructible. This space-vajra, 
      which appears everywhere, cannot be cut with weapons or anything else. It 
      cannot be destroyed by objects or circumstances. Devoid of faults or 
      contamination, it is the great basis of the expansion of the cosmos, so it 
      is real. It cannot be contaminated by faults or virtues, so it is 
      impermeable. It is free of change throughout the three times, so it is 
      immutable. Since everything is pierced in emptiness, it is totally 
      impenetrable. [64] It cannot be modified or changed by anything, so it is 
      utterly imperishable. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This is the space-vajra 
      that appears everywhere. For those who grasp onto substantiality, this is 
      a conventional vajra, and for those who comprehend its nature as 
      unadulterated liberation, this is the ultimate, indestructible vajra. If 
      there were some other object replete with all the seven qualities of a 
      vajra, it would be permanent; but if not, then it is certain that 
      everything is emptiness, which is not established.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Thus, substances that 
      appear as things such as a tree trunk, earth, stone, buildings, and 
      household goods may be pounded, broken, and ground up. By grinding them 
      down to particles, they are reduced to powder. By pulverizing</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 42</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">those particles to 
      one-seventh their size, they are reduced to minute particles; and by 
      disintegrating them to one-seventh their size, they are reduced so that 
      they become partless. They are obliterated and vanish into the nature of 
      space.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Moreover, the ashes of 
      any substance that has been burned in fire naturally disappear into space, 
      and something that appears to be the form of a living being vanishes 
      altogether once it has been killed and burned up. By examining and 
      analyzing all such appearing phenomena in that manner, you find that they 
      all vanish completely, [65] and not a single thing is established in true 
      existence. Intensive inquiry into that topic is essential, so know this!&quot;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Prasannatindra asked, 
      &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, if they are not established and are unreal in that 
      manner, whence do all phenomena arise and appear? May the Teacher 
      explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Prasannatindra, with self-grasping acting as the cause and 
      conceptualization acting as the contributing condition, they exist as mere 
      appearances. The initial consciousness moves to the object, suddenly 
      arousing an appearance. Due to the thought to eliminate it and the 
      appearance of thinking it will be destroyed, it shifts or vanishes 
      altogether. All phenomena are nothing more than mere appearances from 
      dependently related events. There is certainly nothing whatever that is 
      truly existent from its own side. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">For example, due to 
      the&nbsp; simultaneous assembly of someone else's eyes as the cause, with 
      limpid, clear space serving as the basis, and with the substances and 
      mantras used for an illusion and the emanating mind as the contributing 
      conditions, the dependently related event of an illusory emanation appears 
      even though it is nonexistent. Due to the assembled, dependently related 
      events of limpid, clear space as the cause, [66] and warmth and moisture 
      as the contributing conditions, a mirage appears that is not established. 
      From the dependent relationship of the limpid, clear, total-ground 
      consciousness as the&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 43</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">cause and 
      self-grasping as the contributing condition, dream appearances arise that 
      are nonexistent; and one is deluded by grasping onto their reality and 
      clinging to their true existence as if they were appearances in the waking 
      state. Due to the dependent relationship of the simultaneous proximity of 
      a limpid, clear mirror as the cause and someone's face as the contributing 
      condition, a reflection appears that is nonexistent. Due to the dependent 
      relationship of the samadhi of the cultivation of meditative stabilization 
      as the cause and due to the simultaneous proximity of a vessel and 
      moisture as the contributing condition, a city of gandharvas appears as an 
      object. Due to the dependent relationship of a solid, high object such as 
      a boulder and audial consciousness as the cause and making a noise such as 
      shouting as the contributing condition, an echo occurs. Due to the 
      dependent relationship of limpid, clear water as the cause and the 
      simultaneous arising of planets and stars in the sky as the contributing 
      condition, reflections appear. Due to the dependent relationship of water 
      itself as the cause and stirring or agitation as the simultaneous, 
      contributing condition, bubbles emerge. Due to the dependent relationship 
      of the eyes as the cause and simultaneous pressure applied to the eye- 
      channels as the contributing condition, an optical illusion takes place. 
      Due to the dependent relationship of mastery in emanating as the cause and 
      [ 67] entrance into the samadhi of producing emanations as the 
      contributing condition, nonexistent emanations appear. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Thus, for those ten 
      analogies there is dependence due to reliance upon causes, there is a 
      relationship due to the nonduality of the causes and the contributing 
      conditions, and there is origination due to the emergence of nonexistent 
      appearances. In a similar fashion, there arises a continuum of 
      consciousness of self-grasping onto the &quot;I&quot; with respect to the 
      unobstructed, nonobjective displays of the groundless, rootless domain of 
      space, which is the fundamental, absolute nature of the pervasive realm of 
      space. Due to that</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">stream of 
      consciousness, the ground is fragmented: by retracting the self, the 
      fundamental, absolute nature is externalized. From the limpid, clear, 
      mirror-like ground, in which anything can arise, the appearances of the 
      three realms spring forth. As analogies, due to the emergence of foam that 
      is nondual with the ocean, the ocean is set apart; and due to the 
      appearance of rainbows in the sky, which are none other than the sky, the 
      sky appears as something else. There is dependence due to reliance upon 
      the I, there is a relationship due to the nonduality of self and other, 
      and there is origination due to events that have no objective existence. 
      Thus, by investigating the mode of existence of all kinds of appearing 
      phenomena, recognize the crucial point of ascertaining them as displays of 
      the empty space of reality-itself. [68] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Moreover, when you 
      fall asleep, the inanimate world of appearing objects during the waking 
      state, the sentient beings who inhabit the world, and all the appearing 
      objects of the five senses dissolve into the vacuous total-ground, which 
      is of the nature of space; and then they emerge from that domain. Once 
      again self-grasping consciousness is aroused due to the apparitions of the 
      movements of karmic energies. Consequently, due to self-appearances, 
      everything inside and outside, including the inanimate and animate world 
      and sensory objects, emerges as dream appearances, like before, in the 
      fundamental, absolute nature. Joy, sorrow, and indifference are closely 
      held and clung to as being truly existent. This is delusion, so recognize 
      it!&quot; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Samantabhasavyuhendra rose from his seat, bowed reverently, and commented 
      to the Bhagavan, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, I do not accept that all 
      appearances dissolve in that way. When I get into bed, wrap myself in warm 
      bedding, and fall asleep, this array of appearances is left behind.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He asked, &quot;O 
      Samantabhasavyuhendra, when you get into bed, wrap yourself in warm 
      bedding, and fall asleep, if all waking appearances of the inanimate 
      world, its inhabitants, and all sensory objects are left behind, [ 69] 
      where is the enormous inanimate world that objectively appears in the 
      dream state, where are the many sentient beings who inhabit it, and where 
      are the arrays of appearances to the five senses? Tell me: are those 
      emergent objects outside or inside?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Samantabhasavyuhendra 
      replied, &quot;I believe they emerge inside the body.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Abhasavajra, take into consideration all the regions of the body from the 
      interior of the head on down. Tell me: where do those enormous and 
      numerous appearing phenomena, including many mountains and valleys, 
      emerge?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Abhasendra replied, &quot;O 
      Teacher, Bhagavan, when this is examined and analyzed in that way, the 
      head is not large enough to hold such appearances of the animate and 
      inanimate world, nor are the limbs or the torso. I wonder whether 
      consciousness comes out of the body and sees another domain.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Abhasendra, if your awareness and material body are separated like that, 
      and consciousness comes outside, from what orifice does it emerge? [70] 
      And when it returns into the body, by what orifice does it enter? Identify 
      this! What is the location of objects in a dream, and are they present in 
      the cardinal directions, the intermediate directions, above or below? Tell 
      me: do </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 46</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">you think the objects 
      that appear in a dream, including the animate and inanimate world, are the 
      same as those of appearances in the waking state, or are they are 
      different?&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Bodhisattva 
      replied, &quot;I see no such orifice, nor can I identify their being in the 
      east, south, west, or north. I think they are in some other domain.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He continued, 
      &quot;Consider the possibility that [consciousness] passes through an opening. 
      In waking appearances there appear to be doors that allow one to pass in 
      and out of a house, and they can be identified. If it is determined that 
      [consciousness] goes to some direction in this domain, then all the 
      elements and the animate and inanimate world [of the dream-state] would be 
      of the same taste as waking appearances; so they would not be dream 
      appearances. If it were possible for awareness to re-enter the material 
      body after it has been separated from it, there would be no reason why all 
      dead sentient beings couldn't re-enter their own bodies. In the case of a 
      body at night, if the material body does not lose its warmth and become a 
      corpse due to the separation of awareness from matter, there would be no 
      reason why it should lose its warmth at death either. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Therefore, if you 
      believe that daytime appearances and nighttime appearances are the same, 
      are they differentiated by sleep or not? If you believe they are 
      different, is one superimposed upon the other, [71] or does one take place 
      inside and the other outside? Whatever you believe, tell me!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;Teacher, 
      Bhagavan, due to examining and analyzing in that way, I conclude that if 
      [consciousness] were to go elsewhere, the body would become a corpse; and 
      all appearances of the animate and inanimate world would have to be the 
      same. So there would not be any differentiation due to sleep, and at the 
      time of death there would have to be some means of re-entering the body. 
      If daytime appearances and nighttime appearances were different, one of 
      those appearances would have to be superimposed upon the other. If they 
      were the&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 47</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">same, there would be 
      no distinction between waking appearances and dream appearances. Thus, 
      dream appearances emerge after waking appearances have disappeared into 
      the absolute nature.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again 
      Samantabhasavyuhendra addressed the Bhagavan, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, for 
      this body to exist, it must be dependent upon the causes and contributing 
      conditions of one's parents. This raises the objection that appearances do 
      not transform [in the above manner]. So why do these parents appear? Why 
      does this body appear? May the Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Abhasendra, if both parents are necessary for the existence of a body, in 
      the cases of a body in the intermediate state, [72] a dream-body, one that 
      is born from heat and moisture, and one that is born spontaneously, a body 
      appears but there is no mother or father. If you believe this body exists 
      in dependence upon one's parents, before sentient beings became embodied, 
      whence arose the original father? Where did he dwell?&nbsp; Where did he 
      finally go? Examine in the same way the manner in which the [first] mother 
      arose, lived, and departed. Investigate the progression of parents up to 
      this present body. Comprehend this!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Abhasendra responded, 
      &quot;Teacher, Bhagavan, all right. As a result of establishing appearances, I 
      suspect that the appearance of myself alone is a mere appearance and does 
      not exist. Is that so or not? May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O great 
      being, do not think in that way! If as a result of your establishment of 
      all appearances, your perception of everything as empty finally leads you 
      to the conclusion that nothing is empty except the mere nonexistent 
      appearance of yourself alone, you have conflated that which is not empty 
      with that which is empty. And that is merely conditioning yourself to view 
      that which is existent as being nonexistent. Regarding emptiness as 
      conventional, [73] then grasping onto existence as ultimate, if you 
      believe that you alone do not exist </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 48</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">from your own side, 
      that understanding of the emptiness of yourself alone leaves you with the 
      Sravaka view of mere personal identitylessness. Establishing the entire 
      phenomenal world as being like the ten illusory analogies, know that there 
      are no appearing objects apart from the illusionist. From the very time 
      they appear, know that they vanish for the person to whom they appear, and 
      they are not truly existent. Know that as ultimate emptiness.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Abhasendra replied, 
      &quot;This is what I think: they are not the appearances of one sentient being. 
      If all the three realms were merely my own appearances, when the 
      appearances of myself alone changed, all the appearances of the three 
      realms would change accordingly; and they would certainly have to die, to 
      vanish, and to get tired. Since that is not so, I do not think that due to 
      my perception of external objects, the entire animate and inanimate world 
      of the three realms perishes and vanishes together with myself. Thus, may 
      the Teacher truly explain the meaning of this.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He responded, &quot;O 
      Abhasendra, [74] such thoughts of yours are familiar to all sentient 
      beings, who are deluded by grasping onto true existence. Knowing how 
      others behave does not constitute realization of emptiness. For 
      beginningless lifetimes, you have apprehended your own appearances as 
      being something else; and holding onto them, you become deluded. The 
      phenomenal world and all the sensory objects in a dream are not left 
      behind and cast away from the time that you awake. Rather, they all vanish 
      into the realm of the mind. Likewise, all appearances vanish into 
      yourself. You must ascertain that no substantial animate or inanimate 
      world or sense objects exist out there. Holding that just for yourself 
      there are no sentient beings or appearances apart from yourself and then 
      mistakenly taking appearances to be truly existent is sentient beings' 
      path of delusion. So observe that tendency in your mind! When the 
      teachings of the Buddha degenerate, blind sentient beings establish&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 49</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">emptiness and merely 
      come to the conclusion that although the animate and inanimate universe 
      does not exist from one's own perspective, it does exist substantially 
      from its own side. There are very few who identify the ultimate path of 
      emptiness, [75] so carefully examine the nature of this crucial point.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Abhasendra 
      asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, if someone ascertains emptiness on the basis 
      of such nonexistence, doesn't that person's experience of joy and sorrow 
      and movement from one place to another within the three realms of the 
      universe exist? May the Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Abhasendra, for beginningless lifetimes this great sentient being has 
      never revolved within the cycle of existence of the three realms. Although 
      he may have traveled widely from one region to another, they do not exist. 
      His eyes do not see the slightest trace of form. His ears have never heard 
      even the sound of an echo, nor has his nose smelled odors, his tongue 
      experienced tastes, or his body felt tactile sensations. He has never 
      taken even a single step in the three realms of the cycle of existence. He 
      has never exerted the slightest bit of effort towards making a living. He 
      does not sit or rise, nor does he ever move with any of his limbs. Know 
      with certainty that he has never been subject to the experiences of birth, 
      youth, adulthood, old age, illness, death, and so forth.&quot; [76] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Again Abhasendra 
      asked, &quot;O Teacher , Bhagavan, this beginningless and endless delusion is 
      certain, and it is also certain that there is much wandering in the cycle 
      of existence. But countries are seen with the eyes; sounds and voices are 
      heard with the ears; various odors are sensed with the nose; and things 
      that are experienced as tactile objects are seen with the eyes. 
      Ultimately, things are taken in hand, eaten and tasted. All gentle and 
      rough tactile sensations are experienced with the body. We do move around 
      on the ground with our legs, and the appearances of birth, aging, 
      sickness, and death are obvious. And </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 50</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">people do try to make 
      a living by moving about and exerting themselves. Why do you teach that 
      this does not exist? May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">&nbsp;He replied, &quot;O 
      Abhasendra, you do not travel from a region in a dream to a region in the 
      waking state; rather, the appearances simply shift, so to speak. Although 
      you may see a country in a dream, upon looking for it today, not even an 
      iota of it is to be seen. While a variety of sounds and voices, smells, 
      tastes, and different sorts of tactile sensations may appear, if they are 
      checked out today, the ears hear their own sounds, the nose detects its 
      own smells, the tongue experiences its own tastes. Other than that, [77] 
      you have never eaten a single piece of food.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Although you may dream 
      of traveling around a country on foot, not a single step was taken. 
      Although you may exert yourself in various ways to make a living in a 
      dream, check this out today, and you will see that nothing was done for 
      even an instant. Likewise, all the appearances of birth, aging, sick, 
      death, walking, sitting, and movement are nonexistent. From the very 
      moment that those delusive appearances simply arise, they are 
      nonobjective, nonabiding, and baseless; they did not occur nor did they 
      arise. Observe this! Like those examples, all appearances are mere 
      appearances, empty, and not established in reality.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Abhasendra replied, 
      &quot;Dreams and appearances in the waking state are dissimilar. Dreams seem to 
      be delusive appearances, whereas waking appearances seem to be truly 
      existent, stable and incapable of being modified by the mind. So how is 
      that? May the Teacher explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He responded, &quot;O 
      Abhasendra, since this body of yours first appeared and was brought to 
      mind, there have been all manner of waking appearances of working, finding 
      employment, acquiring things, striving, and perceiving sensory objects. 
      Where are they all now? What aims and tasks have been accomplished? </font>
