      investigate them accordingly, reject those who are unworthy vessels, and 
      devote yourself to those who are worthy. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Now, as for practicing 
      the instructions on the great clear light Leap-over, if you do not first 
      engage in the profound preliminary techniques, there will be a great many 
      obstacles and pitfalls to your practice. Therefore, in the phase of the 
      preliminaries, apply yourself to the segregation of samsara and nirvana 
      with respect to your body, speech, and mind. First, for the outer 
      segregation, go to a solitary place in a deep ravine with no people 
      around, and reflect, &quot;In order to free all sentient beings of the three 
      realms from the ocean of suffering of mundane existence, I shall segregate 
      samsara from nirvana with respect to my body, speech, and mind; and I 
      shall bring them to the state of omniscient, perfect awakening.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then apply this to 
      your own mind in the following way: &quot;When I am beset with a virulent, 
      unbearable, fatal disease, my mind will be filled with terrible anguish, 
      and I shall groan and writhe on the ground in agony. My loved ones will 
      repeatedly give me advice and go for a doctor. The doctor will then come, 
      examine my pulse, then tell me the prognosis is so bad that it seems there 
      is nothing he can do to help. So now I must quickly have many rituals done 
      for me, for I have come to the point where I can lose everything; and I 
      shall act&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 277 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">accordingly. My family 
      will advise me to have a divination done by a psychic and to have an 
      astrologer make his own prognosis. When the messengers eventually return 
      from making those requests, my family and I will ask what they said. The 
      psychic and astrologer will say that rituals must be&nbsp; done on my behalf, 
      so I must act quickly. But then hearing that all psychics and astrologers 
      are so deeply at odds with each other that they are of no use, I fall into 
      intense despair. Imagining many rituals being done, I finally fall on my 
      bed, unable to rise. My lips and face move, my eyes turn upwards, whatever 
      I drink comes out my nose; and quivering on my bed, I beg to be lifted 
      from the depths into which I have fallen. [396] With anxiety and clinging 
      to my human environment, I ask to be taken outside and to be consoled. I 
      am then carried outside, but the&nbsp; whole earth seems deserted, and by 
      simply casting my eyes on my surroundings, I sense I will not be here for 
      long. My mind is then overwhelmed with unbearable grief. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Once again, out of 
      attachment to my own home and family, I am tormented by the thought that I 
      am about to be separated from them. I then ask to be taken back indoors, 
      and when I am laid on my bed, all my relatives recognize that I am dying. 
      They gather around me and take hold of my head and limbs. Clinging to my 
      body, their faces are covered with tears. I hear them wailing and moaning. 
      I see with my very eyes that the envoys of the Lord of Death are coming to 
      take me away. When the agents of&nbsp; Yama come before me and are about to 
      lead me away, I am unable to let go of my beloved children and wife and 
      all my dear brothers and other relatives, even though I must. The time has 
      come--even though I cannot bear to leave them--when I will have no choice 
      but to go where I will not see or meet them again. I will have to make my 
      way alone to an unknown destination, [397] with no friends or companions, 
      leaving behind my cherished body and all my clothes, ornaments, food, 
      wealth, and&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 278 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">home. By imagining 
      that this occasion has come upon me now, forcefully arousing a sense of 
      terror, and acting in every way as if this were happening, I train for the 
      transitional process of dying. By so doing, I will certainly turn away&nbsp; 
      from clinging to the appearances of this life.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then imagine that all 
      external appearances dissolve into your consciousness, bringing forth a 
      vision of a pale sheen. That dissolves into an increasing light, and you 
      imagine a reddish sheen like a flash of lightning. Then as that dissolves 
      into darkness, a gloom overtakes the mind like the appearance of pitch 
      blackness. Then there is death, and by training for the time you will die, 
      you will turn away from obsessive clinging. Then bring to mind a limpidity 
      and clarity like space and remain in meditative equipoise for as long as 
      you can in a state of pervasive, clear emptiness. That is the experience 
      of the ground clear light. Then cover your eyes with a [diaphanous] 
      blindfold and remain in meditative equipoise focused on the appearances of 
      the five lights. That is training in the appearances of the transitional 
      process of reality-itself. [398] Then bring to mind the visions of the 
      transitional process of becoming, imagine that you unimpededly go wherever 
      you think of going, and remain in that state for awhile. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Finally, imagine that 
      many terrifying agents of Yama catch you around the waste with lassos, 
      strike you with various weapons, and draw you helplessly into the dark. 
      The fierce gale of karma pushes you from behind until you come before Yama, 
      Dharmaraja. In the presence of Dharmaraja, the great workman Attachment, 
      bearing the head of a monkey, Delusion, bearing the head of a bull, and 
      Hatred, bearing the head of a snake, hold a scale for weighing the pebbles 
      of karma, a mirror that reflects good and evil, and a book of accounts 
      registering the quantities [of good and evil deeds]. They are surrounded 
      by innumerable workmen bearing heads that change shape. In front of them 
      on your right is a&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 279 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">white, co-arisen68 
      devaputra; on your left is a black mara who accompanies you; and the two 
      of them in succession report to Dharmaraja on the nature of your virtues 
      and vices. The black mara wins his case, and finally Dharmaraja commands 
      that the white and black pebbles of karma be put on the scale. [399] The 
      deva and mara weigh them, the bull-headed creature examines them, and the 
      black pebbles prove to be heavier. Examining the mirror, it is seen that 
      evil is predominant; and upon looking at the accounts, it appears that 
      nonvirtuous deeds are far more prevalent. Consequently, Dharmaraja 
      immediately commands, &quot;In this life this person has avoided positive, 
      virtuous deeds as if they were poison and has adopted negative vices as if 
      they were medicine. Let these deeds fully ripen now! Take this person to 
      the hot hells!' As if they were taking culprits to prison, the workmen all 
      shout together in voices like a thousand peals of thunder, &quot;Kill!&nbsp; Kill!&nbsp; 
      Mutilate! Mutilate!&quot; and drive many sentient beings to hell. There you are 
      surrounded by an unbroken, seamless, burning, metal ground. The space 
      around you is entirely filled with flickering tongues of flame. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In the Resuscitation 
      hell, hostile beings regard each other as deadly enemies, battle to the 
      death with various weapons, then they are revitalized. In the Black Line 
      hell, lines are drawn on one's body, which is then dismembered with a 
      burning metal saw. In the Confinement and Destruction hell, one&nbsp; is placed 
      in a burning metal mortar and pulverized with a red-hot pestle. [400] In 
      the Wailing hell, one suffers due to being trapped inside a blazing, metal 
      building with no doors. In the Shrieking hell, one is forced into a 
      two-story, blazing, metal building and is incinerated there. In the Hot 
      hell, one is run through with a blazing, metal trident. In the Scorching 
      hell, one is immersed in molten iron, copper, and bronze. In Avici hell, 
      one is incinerated together with a torch of flaming iron. Imagine taking 
      on all the sufferings of those hells, and really act </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">68 This deva is 
      co-arisen with yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 280 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">out the various cries 
      and expressions of those experiencing them. Experiencing such terror and 
      despair is the segregation with respect to the mind. Physically writhing 
      on the ground, rising up, and flailing your limbs is the segregation with 
      respect to the body. Orally wailing and screaming is the way of making the 
      segregation with respect to the speech. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In the cold hells the 
      ground all around one is frozen and one is crushed under a blizzard. There 
      are eight cold hells called the Blister, the Perforated Blister, the Achu, 
      the Wailing, the Chattering Teeth, the Splintered like a Lotus, the 
      Splintered like an Utpala, and the Splintered like a Great Lotus. [401] 
      Imagine taking upon yourself the miseries of the eight cold hells and the 
      peripheral, minor hells, and so forth. Act out the expressions and cries 
      of beings there, and constantly roll on the ground and move about in 
      various ways as if you were in agony. Practice to the point that you 
      actually feel that you are taking on such suffering. Likewise, act as if 
      you were experiencing the hunger and thirst of the pretas, the enforced 
      labor, slaying and so on of animals, the birth, aging, sickness, and death 
      of humans, the conflicts of the asuras, and the death and downfall of the 
      devas. Physically crouch down, jump, run, get up, move around, sit, move 
      you limbs and so on; orally make various sounds; and mentally imagine 
      taking on various experiences of joy and sorrow. Experiencing that is the 
      phase of training for the intermediate state. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Cultivate a spirit of 
      emergence and a sense of disillusionment with respect to the cycle of 
      existence to the point at which you are as nauseated as a person with 
      hepatitis being offered cooked food. This will cause you turn away from 
      craving for samsara and apply yourself to the sublime Dharma for the time 
      being; and ultimately it will cause samsara to be dredged from its depths. 
      If you do not bring the visions of the transitional process to mind and 
      experience them, [402] a spirit of emergence will not arise from the 
      depths of your being. As a </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page&nbsp; 281 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">result of not taking 
      those experiences to heart, even though you hear accounts of the 
      sufferings of dying and the cycle of existence, you will regard them 
      merely as conditions somewhere else, and there will be only the remotest 
      chance that you will apply their significance to your own mind-stream. 
      Thus, if you bring them to your own mind and train in those appearances, 
      their significance will certainly come to you. So appreciate the 
      importance of this mind training! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">When you have finished 
      training in repeatedly bringing all those appearances of samsara to mind, 
      instantly transform your appearances and imagine this external, inanimate 
      universe as emptiness, the absolute nature free of conceptual 
      elaborations. With this nature, imagine the whole earth as being free of 
      all rough surfaces such as jagged mountains, rugged, rocky ravines, and 
      thorn trees. Imagine its surface to be soft and even like the palm of a 
      young woman and expansive like the sky, such that it gives when you press 
      on it and rebounds when you lift off from it. Aromatic fragrances loft 
      from grassy hills of medicinal herbs. The entire ground is covered by 
      blossoming flowers of various colors. [403] The sky is covered with 
      checkered patterns of rainbows and lattices of light rays. Clouds of 
      offerings of sensory objects float and billow up in the sky like summer 
      mist rising from the ocean. Imagine purifying springs, ponds bearing the 
      eight qualities of ambrosia, wish-fulfilling trees, beautiful, exquisite&nbsp; 
      birds of various species, different kinds of intelligent forest creatures, 
      emanated circles of male and female bodhisattvas adorned with the signs 
      and symbols of enlightenment, who are calm, fresh, limpid, and free of 
      contamination, and young people sixteen years of age adorned with 
      beautiful, attractive ornaments and garments, casually strolling along the 
      ground.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In the center of this 
      unimaginable, innumerable assembly of invincible lotus blossoms, imagine 
      yourself upon a Dharma throne as the Bhagavan, the Jina Sakyamuni, with 
      your body radiant with light like a golden mountain&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 282 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">embraced by a hundred 
      thousand suns. You sit with your legs in the vajrasana position.&nbsp; Your 
      right hand touches the earth, and your left is in the mudra of meditative 
      equipoise. [404] Bearing a calm and smiling countenance, you are clothed 
      with the three kinds of robes. You are adorned with the excellent thirty 
      two signs and eighty symbols of enlightenment. From the tip of every one 
      of your body hairs, inconceivable, countless trillions of light rays are 
      emitted, pervading everywhere throughout the three realms. At the tip of 
      each light ray, a great ray of light takes on the form of various, 
      individual sentient beings, with their race, language, and customs, and 
      dispels the ignorance of each one, like the sun dispelling darkness; and 
      it subdues their mind-streams by revealing the Dharma, and draws them into 
      spiritual practice. Imagine everyone transforming into manifestations of 
      male and female bodhisattvas, filling to overflowing the buddha-field you 
      have created, and listening to the Dharma. You recite The Heart Sutra and 
      so forth, and explain the Dharma. Imagine that they all come to know the 
      great, ultimate, absolute nature; and as the illusory fictions of the 
      phenomenal world dissolve into the original, primordial ground, the 
      absolute nature of Samantabhadra, they become enlightened and the whole of 
      samsara of the three realms becomes empty. By settling in meditative 
      equipoise in that awareness, you establish the circumstances for purifying 
      your buddha-field. And in the meantime, by engaging in the conduct of the 
      Three Jewels, [405] you are seen as the Teacher of all sentient beings, 
      and outer, inner, and secret obstacles are dispelled. Finally, you emanate 
      your buddha-field, with its Teacher and circle of disciples, you 
      experience your own goal of the dharmakaya, and by the very force of that 
      the goals of others will be accomplished with the power of great 
      blessings. That is called the outer segregation of the body, speech, and 
      mind. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The following is the 
      inner segregation of the body, speech, and mind. On the top of your head 
      of your normal body imagine the deva seed of the white&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 283 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">syllable A in the form 
      of an orb of dim light. Imagine the causes of birth as a deva, together 
      with the karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities, converging 
      in the form of a dim white light and dissolving into that seed. At your 
      throat visualize as before the asura seed of SU in the form of a yellow 
      orb of light, and imagine the causes of birth as an asura, together with 
      all the karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities, converging 
      in the form of greenish yellow light and dissolving into the SU. At your 
      heart visualize the human seed in the form of a light blue NRI. Rays of 
      light are emitted from it, drawing in all the causes of birth as a human, 
      together with the karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities, 
      and imagine them dissolving into the NRI. At your navel visualize the 
      animal seed of a dark red TRI, and as before, [406] imagine all the karma, 
      mental afflictions, and habitual propensities that act as causes for 
      rebirth as an animal being drawn in and dissolving into the TRI. At your 
      genital region visualize rays of light being emitted from the preta seed 
      of a gray PRE, drawing in all the karma, mental afflictions, and habitual 
      propensities that act as causes for rebirth as a preta, together with the 
      miseries associated with such rebirth, and imagine them dissolving into 
      the PRE. On the soles of your feet imagine light emanating from the hell 
      seed-syllable of a black, shimmering DU, retracting in the form of black 
      light all the karma, mental afflictions, sins, obscurations, and habitual 
      propensities in the minds of all sentient beings that act as causes for 
      rebirth in hell, together with the miseries of such rebirth. Imagine them 
      all dissolving into that seed, leaving not even a residual trace behind. 
      That is the training. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then on the crown of 
      your head imagine the essential nature of the bodies of all the tathagatas 
      as a white OM, blazing with greater brilliance than the light of a hundred 
      thousand suns. The light emanated from that syllable draws in all the 
      inexhaustible ornamental wheels of the bodies of the jinas and jinaputras
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 284 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">of the three times in 
      the form of a mass of white light, which dissolves into the white OM. At 
      your throat imagine the seed of enlightened speech as a red AH, which 
      emanates light as before, drawing in all the inexhaustible wheels of the 
      speech of all the jinas and jinaputras of the three times in the form of a 
      mass of red light, which dissolves into the AH. [407] At your heart 
      imagine the seed of the enlightened mind as a dark blue HUM, which blazes 
      with light and emanates light rays, drawing in all the inexhaustible 
      wheels of the minds, qualities, and enlightened activities of the jinas 
      and jinaputras of the three times in the form of a mass of dark blue 
      light, which dissolves into the HUM.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then imagine roaring 
      flames of white, red, and dark blue light rays blazing forth from the 
      purifying three vajra essences, utterly incinerating all the seeds of 
      hell, together with their habitual propensities. Recite OM, AH, HUM, and 
      imagine them likewise incinerating the cycle of existence in both reverse 
      and forward order. Do not let your consciousness be distracted elsewhere; 
      do not interrupt this with human speech; and recognize the importance of 
      meditating and reciting without letting your meditation cushion grow cold. 
      At the conclusion, the mass of light grows larger, totally incinerating 
      illnesses, malevolent spirits, sins, obscurations, habitual propensities, 
      and the material aggregate of flesh and blood. Then visualize your body as 
      a rainbow or as an empty appearance, a mass of light like a reflection in 
      a mirror, and recite. Recite the vajra-recitation of the three seeds, 
      together with its ancillaries, one hundred thousand times for each of the 
      seeds to be purified, [408] making a total of seven hundred thousand 
      recitations. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As a result of 
      meditation in that way without distraction and single- pointed recitations 
      uninterrupted by idle chatter, actual experiences in your dreams may 
      include a sense of pristine space, the occurrence of extraordinary 
      experiential realizations, ascending to the peak of a mountain that 
      reaches to the&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">heights of the sky, 
      flying in the sky, puss, blood, and lymph oozing from your body, many 
      parasites emerging from your body, intentionally torching a building, 
      seeing buddha-fields, and having visions of deities. Those experiences 
      arise as signs of having purified all illnesses, malevolent spirits, sins, 
      and obscurations. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The foregoing is 
      called segregation. Your own ground, which consists of spontaneous 
      displays of the three embodiments, is contaminated by, and mixed with, the 
      taints of habitual propensities of the three realms. Those practices 
      purify the cycle of existence in the absolute nature, make the three 
      embodiments manifest, and thereby bring about a segregation. The seeds 
      that produce the body are incinerated, the vajra-body is made manifest, 
      and that is called the segregation of the body. The mantras are recited 
      verbally, the vajra-speech is made manifest, and that is called the 
      segregation of the speech.&nbsp; The severance of the mental stream of delusive 
      conceptualization, [409] and the meditation on the generation [of yourself 
      and your environment as a buddha and a buddha-field] is called the 
      segregation of the mind. That is analogous to a method for separating the 
      kernel from the chaff, throwing away the chaff, and keeping the kernel.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">By inwardly making 
      such a segregation, in the short-term habitual propensities and 
      obscurations are purified, and there will be no obstacles or interferences 
      to your life and spiritual practice; and finally you will become a buddha, 
      as your body, speech, and mind are displayed as the three vajras. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">After that has been 
      completed, samsara and nirvana are to be secretly segregated with respect 
      to your body, speech, and mind. First of all, samsara and nirvana are to 
      be segregated with respect to your body as follows. All the inexhaustible 
      ornamental wheels of the bodies, speech, minds, qualities, and enlightened 
      activities of all the buddhas, bodhisattvas, gurus, jinas, and jinaputras 
      of the ten directions and the three times dissolve into yourself in the 
      form of a mass of five-colored light. Imagine that they completely clear 
      out all illnesses,&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 286 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">malevolent spirits, 
      sins, obscurations, habitual propensities, and material aggregates, and 
      you expand into the nature of all-pervasive space; and remain for awhile 
      in that meditative equipoise. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then join your palms 
      above the crown of your head while spreading out your elbows. Join the 
      soles of your feet [410] and stand with your knees spread out to the 
      sides. Imagine that your body instantly transforms into a blazing, 
      three-pronged, meteorite vajra, like a rainbow appearing in the sky. Know 
      that the upper central prong symbolizes the primordial wisdom of the 
      essential nature of emptiness; the right prong symbolizes the primordial 
      wisdom of the nature of luminosity; and the left prong symbolizes the 
      primordial wisdom of all-pervasive compassion. Know that the lower central 
      prong symbolizes the dharmakaya, the right prong symbolizes the 
      sambhogakaya, and the left prong symbolizes the nirmanakaya. Visualize the 
      natural luster of primordial wisdom in the form of a blazing mass of fire, 
      and remain in meditative equipoise without distraction for as long as 
      seems fit. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">When you can no longer 
      sit like that, while maintaining the same visualization as before, 
      alternate between lying on your back and sitting in the squatting 
      position. By diligently meditating like that for a sustained period, all 
      demons and obstructive forces will see your body as a blazing vajra, and 
      they will not be able to come within seven yojanas of you; and finally 
      your body will awaken in the nature of the vajra-body. [411]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Second, for 
      segregating the speech, first there is the practice of sealing [with HUM]. 
      To unify external appearances, imagine a blue syllable HUM in your mouth, 
      which successively emits white, yellow, red, and green HUMs, completely 
      filling and pervading the whole of space. Imagine all the elements of 
      earth, water, fire, and air transforming into the nature of HUM, without 
      leaving even a trace of the elements behind. To unify your own internal 
      body, imagine&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 287 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">all the external HUMs 
      converging one by one and entering your mouth. The whole interior of your 
      body is filled with HUMs, and your entire body, from the top of your head 
      to the soles of your feet, consists of HUMs right down to the atomic 
      level. Imagine your body in the dark blue, wrathful and ferocious form of 
      Vajrapani. Imagine that your right hand holds a vajra and your left hand 
      holds a serpent noose. You stand powerfully and haughtily, with your legs 
      spread wide apart, in the midst of a blazing fire of primordial wisdom. 
      Everything that has been unified externally and internally takes on the 
      pleasing sound of gently melodious HUM. That leads to the realization of 
      appearances being like illusions, and it has the purpose of liberating 
      your body as being devoid of an inherent nature. [412] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for training in 
      power, the training with respect to external appearances is as follows. 
      From your mouth, a powerful, sharp, darting, dark blue HUM, one cubit in 
      length, shoots forth like a lightning bolt, striking every physical object 
      such as mountains, boulders, and stones, thoroughly penetrating each one. 
      Imagine that everything transforms into empty space, leaving not even a 
      trace behind, and while in that state powerfully and harshly recite HUM. 
      Then rest without focusing on anything at all. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The training in power 
      with respect to your own body is as follows. Imagine that a dark blue HUM, 
      one cubit in length, emerges from your body in its ordinary state. 
      Penetrating straight into the exterior and interior of your body, it 
      pierces in every direction, leaving no spot untouched. Imagine your body 
      disintegrating into nothingness, and recite HUM many times in a fierce, 
      harsh voice. As a result, if the flesh of your body goes into little 
      spasms and swelling occurs, those are signs of having trained in power 
      with respect to your body. The purpose of that is to realize the lack of 
      inherent existence of&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 288 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">appearances, to subdue 
      the demon of reification, and to powerfully realize emptiness. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The practice of 
      malleability is as follows. While sitting cross-legged on a comfortable 
      cushion, imagine a dark blue HUM at your heart. [413] From it a strand of 
      light rays of many dark blue HUMs issues forth from your mouth. It coils 
      clockwise around the base of a meditative support in front of you such as 
      a stick. The first HUM that emerged stands on top of the meditative 
      support, and while directly thrusting your attention at that, slowly and 
      melodiously chant the sound of HUM. Then forcefully concentrate on that 
      strand of HUMs gradually unraveling from the meditative support, imagine 
      finally drawing it back into your heart, and come to rest. Then 
      alternately visualize white, yellow,&nbsp; red, and green HUMs. Repeated 
      training of that sort will in the short-term dispel obstacles that make 
      your channels dysfunctional, and finally it will provide you with mastery 
      over your vital energies and mind. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Once again visualize 
      yourself as dark blue, wrathful, and ferocious Vajrapani, holding aloft a 
      meteorite vajra in your right hand, and with your left hand in the 
      threatening gesture holding a serpent noose. From the HUM at your heart, 
      HUMs are emitted like swirling particles of dust in the sunlight. All 
      appearances of samsara and nirvana, including the animate and inanimate 
      universe and all sensory objects, dissolve into the syllables HUM like 
      salt dissolving into water, leaving not even a trace behind. [414] Imagine 
      drawing them back in again, entering your mouth and filling your body, 
      causing it to increase in size until it pervades the entire domain of 
      space. Visualize HUMs emanating throughout the whole of samsara and 
      nirvana, completely pervading it like a covering of mist, and on occasion 
      transform them into white, yellow, red, and green forms. Do not let your 
      attention be distracted elsewhere, and recognize the importance of this. 
      In the short term that practice will make you&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">invulnerable to all 
      interferences, and its final aim is to dissolve your body into minute 
      particles and to liberate your awareness as the dharmakaya.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This is the way to 
      enter the path. Imagine your body transforming into a blazing white 
      syllable HUM, one cubit above the ground, tilting this way and that way, 
      and imagine yourself gradually moving throughout all the realms of the six 
      types of sentient beings of the enduring billionfold world-systems, each 
      with its Mt. Meru, four continents, and subcontinents. Then, like an arrow 
      shot by a powerful archer, you successively proceed to Abhirati in the 
      east, Srimat in the south, Sukhavati in the west, Karmaprapurana in the 
      north, and to Ghanavyuha in the center. [415] Imagine that you behold the 
      five classes of buddhas and receive teachings, prophecies, and 
      empowerments from them. While visualizing that, beautifully, slowly, and 
      melodiously recite HUM. That serves the needs of sentient beings and 
      purifies the buddha-fields, and by so doing, those ends will finally be 
      accomplished. In the short term it also has the effect of bringing about a 
      sense of disillusionment, disgust, and revulsion toward all activities of 
      samsara.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">By applying yourself 
      in those ways to the practice of segregation with respect to the speech, 
      your speech will awaken as a display of the vajra-speech. When all verbal 
      defects vanish and you attract others with the sweetness of your voice, 
      those are signs of purification. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Now to strive to 
      segregate the mind, go to a very remote, solitary place where there are no 
      thorns to meditative stabilization. Then, in order to dispel great, 
      disturbing, obstructive forces that may arise due to physical disturbances 
      brought on by the preceding practices, first of all settle in your natural 
      state: motionlessly relax your body in whatever way is comfortable, like 
      an unthinking corpse in a charnel ground. Let your voice be silent like a 
      lute with its strings cut. Rest your mind in an unmodified state, like the 
      primordial presence of space.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">[416] Remain for a 
      long time in those three ways. That pacifies all illnesses due to 
      disturbances of the elements and unfavorable circumstances, and your body, 
      speech, and mind naturally calm down. The ultimate purpose of that 
      practice is to experience the dharmakaya, free of activity . </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">To enter into your own 
      innate stability ,69 position your body in the sevenfold posture of 
      Vairocana, direct your gaze over the tip of your nose, and rest in 
      meditative equipoise, letting your experienced thoughts be, without 
      intervention. Then assume the bodhisattva gaze, with your eyes directed 
      about six feet in front of you, and remain with a sense of limitless 
      consciousness. Then assume a ferocious gaze, standing powerfully and 
      haughtily, with your legs spread wide apart. Point your right hand to the 
      sky in a threatening gesture, point your attention in the same direction, 
      and bellow out 'Ha Ha!' Reach out with your left hand in a threatening 
      gesture, point it to the sky, and ferociously bellow forth 'Hi Hi!' Then 
      rest without directing your attention to any appearances. That will 
      empower your awareness in the great depths of reality-itself. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">By segregating samsara 
      and nirvana in those ways, [417] you will become a suitable vessel for the 
      unsurpassed secret, and your body, speech, and mind will transform into 
      the nature of the three vajras. Reinforce this external, internal, and 
      secret segregation of the body, speech, and mind by practicing that for no 
      less than eighty days, and not for just a day or two. As explained 
      previously, it is of crucial importance that you practice that until you 
      experience all the signs and qualities of having dispelled the problems 
      and defects of your body, speech, and mind and of having purified sins and 
      obscurations. So practice that for a long time. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Now as for the stages 
      of the main practice, at first you determine the ground by way of the 
      Breakthrough, then the initial moment of impure consciousness emerges in 
      the aspect of an object, a subsequent conceptualization fastens onto it, 
      and delusion sets in. Now, in contrast, in the Leap-over, the initial&nbsp; 
      moment of consciousness is transformed into an appearance of clear light, 
      and by experiencing the very nature of consciousness, all impure 
      appearances dissolve into the absolute nature and vanish. Knowing how that 
      occurs is the indispensable, sublime point of the Leap-over, so recognize 
      it! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you do not 
      recognize this vital point, however much you meditate, you will go&nbsp; astray 
      on the path of dualistic grasping, [418] and you will not progress along 
      the grounds and paths of liberation. Thus, once you have truly realized 
      the manner in which the whole of samsara and nirvana is none other than 
      your own appearances, finally all mental states and appearances of the 
      impure cycle of existence will forcefully be transformed into displays of 
      the clear light, reality itself. So this is the practical guidance on the 
      great transference. By truly recognizing the entrance to this path with 
      the wisdom of realizing identitylessness, originally pure reality-itself, 
      beyond mental investigation, the absolute nature free of conceptual 
      elaboration, will be experienced with the eye of expansive wisdom. Unlike 
      nebulous, obscure meditations and intellectual fabrications, with the eye 
      of wisdom you directly see the precious, spontaneously present absolute 
      nature, the reality-itself of the expanse of clear light. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">To practice these 
      instructions, at the outset you must firm up your posture, for if this is 
      not done, the absolute nature, bindus, and the vital energies will be 
      dispersed in all the channels and elements of the body, and they will not 
      manifest. As an analogy, if a snake is not squeezed, its limbs will not

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">evident, but if it is, 
      they appear. The posture is accordingly of tremendous importance. [419]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">First, the lion's 
      posture is as follows. Join the soles of your feet in front of you. Plant 
      your vajra-fists on the ground between your legs, and look up into the 
      sky. That is the dharmakaya posture and gaze. For the sambhogakaya 
      posture, plant your knees and elbows on the ground and support your cheeks 
      with your palms. Point the soles of your feet outward, and gaze directly 
      in front of you. However, if appearances of the clear light do not 
      manifest, alternately run your gaze to the left and right and up and down. 
      Rest your gaze wherever those appearances are most clear. For the 
      nirmanakaya posture plant the soles of your feet on the ground, press your 
      chest against your knees and clasp your knees with both hands while 
      interlacing your fingers. Straighten your spine, and gaze downwards.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Here is the 
      significance of those postures. With the dharmakaya posture, the soles of 
      the feet are joined in order to constrain the afflictive vital energies in 
      their own place. The vajra-fists are placed on the ground to cut off the 
      pathways of the afflictions. The gaze is directed upwards to open the 
      vision of primordial wisdom. With the sambhogakaya posture, pointing the 
      soles outward causes the vital energies to flow easily. [420] Pressing 
      your knees against your chest balances the heat and cold elements of the 
      body. Pointing your knees and elbows at the ground blocks the impure 
      apertures. Supporting your cheeks with your palms balances bliss and 
      emptiness. By directing your gaze straight in front of you, primordial 
      wisdom settles in its own luminosity. With the nirmanakaya posture, the 
      soles of your feet press on the air mandala in order to suppress the power 
      of the karmic vital energies. By pressing together the fire mandala of the 
      thighs and the fire mandala of the belly, the impure vital energies of 
      samsara are extinguished right where they are. By pressing together the 
      water&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">mandala of the knees 
      and the fire mandala of the palms, the heat and cold elements of the body 
      are balanced. By pressing together the fire mandala of the palms and the 
      fire mandala of the armpits, cold disorders are dispelled. By pressing 
      together the water mandala of the backs of the hands and the water mandala 
      of the throat, heat disorders are dispelled. By gazing downwards, the eye 
      of omniscience is opened. Even if you look straight ahead or turn your 
      gaze upwards, the eye of omniscience is still opened, so there is no 
      difference. You may direct your gaze wherever you find the greatest 
      clarity. [421] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Moreover, it is not 
      necessary to use all three postures. Rather, you may stay in any of the 
      postures that facilitates the arising of the clear light and that you find 
      comfortable and suitable. If you like variety, you may shift from one 
      posture to the other and from time to time apply yourself to other 
      spiritual practices. If you want nothing complicated, strive in meditation 
      continuously throughout the day and night. Those who can meditate only 
      during the day and not through the night should constantly practice 
      throughout the day. The practice is to have three special sessions during 
      the night and to intermittently train in the dying process.70</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The important thing 
      for the senses is that you look with eyes partially open and that you do 
      not suddenly open them wide, for that will dull your vision, and it will 
      prevent the appearances of the clear light from manifesting; so do not 
      rigidly fix your gaze. The important thing for the vital energies is that 
      you practice breathing gently through your mouth through a little opening 
      between your lips and teeth; and pause for a moment with the breath 
      exhaled. As for the object of your gaze, in the beginning for about one 
      month, during the daytime direct your gaze one cubit71 from the sun; then

      achieve stability in the clear light, gaze at the moon in the same way. 
      [422] At night if you gaze at a flame, by looking above it with your eyes 
      half open, at first you will see nothing more than something like an 
      orange bale of hay. After awhile, the absolute nature will appear and 
      bindus will arise in the form of quivering lines. Finally, beautiful, 
      limpid visions of the absolute nature and bindus will appear clearly and 
      extensively. Remain with your body unmoving like a corpse in a charnel 
      ground; keep your voice silent, avoiding all articulation; and do not 
      exhale through your nose but slowly breathe through your mouth without 
      impeding or forcing it. That is the reliance upon the crucial point of 
      letting the channels and vital energies be, without retention or 
      manipulation. Remain without moving from the state in which consciousness 
      experientially emerges as the clear light, without the mind being 
      modified&nbsp; in any way. Wherever you are, by keeping the body straight, all 
      the channels and vital energies will be straight, and once the mind has 
      dissolved into empty awareness, you will be stabilized in that state.

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The explanation of the 
      channels and bindus of the path according to this yana is called Ati-anu, 
      so you should come to know them correctly. The mouth is the aperture 
      through which coarse, impure mental afflictions, vital energies, and 
      mental states manifest, and the nose is the subtle aperture for subtle 
      afflictions, vital energies, and mental states. Here is the way they move. 
      In the lungs, [423] channels having the width of a straw of wheat are 
      filled with that which is called the exhaled and inhaled breaths. If they 
      increase, heat disorders arise, if they decrease, cold disorders occur, 
      and if the breath flows smoothly, there is a balance of the heat and cold 
      elements of the body. In one day, there are 21,600</font></p>

      daytime practice of gazing near the sun may impair one's vision, it is 
      said that&nbsp; the nighttime practice of gazing at the moon may actually 
      enhance one's vision. Most important is that one carefully examine whether 
      one's practice is damaging one's eyesight and to alter the&nbsp; practice if 
      that occurs.&nbsp; </font></p>

      like mounts for mental ideation. Therefore, even though there are profound 
      methods for forcefully constraining the vital energies and mind by 
      retaining and manipulating the channels and breath, they may be enormously 
      obstructive and misleading. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The six kinds of 
      lamps73 of the ground of the nature of existence are the avenues by which 
      primordial wisdom arises, and the eyes are the evident apertures of 
      primordial wisdom. The ears are the hidden apertures of subtle primordial 
      wisdom, and they are the pathways by which consciousness apprehends 
      appearances, so you train in their sounds. Through the evident apertures 
      of primordial wisdom, you train in the clear light that illuminates the 
      darkness. Dream appearances are the avenues to the manifestation of 
      stainless vision, and by familiarizing yourself with the clear light, 
      emanation, and transformation, the appearances in the transitional process 
      of becoming can be emanated and transformed. From that you can emanate a 
      pristine nirmanakaya buddha-field and accustom yourself to transforming 
      the appearances of the intermediate state. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">[424] Here in order to 
      experience the visions of the embodiments and primordial wisdoms there are 
      three kinds of lamps of the vessel. The quintessence of the body is the 
      citta lamp of the flesh at the heart, the inside of which is soft white. 
      This is called the lamp of the channels, the quintessence of the channels, 
      and hollow crystal kati channel. It is a single channel, one-eighth the 
      width of a hair of a horse's tail, with two branches that penetrate inside 
      the heart like the horns of a wild ox. They curve around the back of the 
      ears and come to the pupils of the eyes. Their root is the heart, their 
      trunk is the channels, and their fruit is the eyes.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">73 The use of the term 
      lamp (Tib. sgron me) is, of course, a metaphor, for the essential nature 
      of these lamps is luminosity.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The quintessence of 
      the apertures is called the fluid Lasso lamp. That consists of three kinds 
      of lamps of the vessel. Although the three kinds of lamps of the vessel 
      are given three names, in reality they refer to the same thing, like a 
      root, trunk, and fruit. Thus, in the context of the path, they are simply 
      called the fluid lasso lamp. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the three kinds 
      of lamps of the vital essence, the lamp of the pristine absolute nature is 
      the quintessence of the five outer elements. The transformation of 
      impurities into the five-colored lights of the empty essential nature of 
      the quintessence is called the absolute nature, and because of the 
      purification of the reification of impurities, it is called pristine. The 
      element appearing as space, transformed into the quintessence, is blue and 
      light blue. The element appearing [425] as water, transformed into the 
      quintessence, is white and gray. The element appearing as fire, 
      transformed into the quintessence, is red and brown. The element appearing 
      as earth, transformed into the quintessence, is yellow, pale yellow, and 
      dark yellow. The element of air, transformed into the quintessence, 
      appears as green, tan, and light green. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At first, in whatever 
      color the impure visions appear, when they are&nbsp; transformed into the 
      absolute nature, they still appear in that same color. As for the visions 
      of the absolute nature, at first they are of the nature of such things as 
      the sun, moon, and a flame, bearing all five colors, filled with rainbow 
      patterns of the absolute nature, like brilliant brocade. This rainbow 
      weave arises as horizontal images. Beginners may achieve stability in this 
      by gazing for a month at the sun and a crystal during the daytime, at the 
      moon during the nighttime, and by gazing at a flame while indoors. At the 
      beginning, shimmering images arise, after awhile they become more stable, 
      and finally they remain motionless. At that time, look at a clear window, 
      dispense with the flaws of enjoying or not enjoying the beauty or lack of 
      beauty of the light images. Then&nbsp; </font></p>

      which is not that of the external sky, but know that it is important to 
      rest in a state without attraction or aversion to its qualities. [426]

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">To transform the five 
      inner elements into quintessences, the element of the quintessence of the 
      mind is transformed into blue and it appears as such; the element of the 
      quintessence of the blood transforms into the color white and appears as 
      such; the element of the quintessence of the flesh transforms into the 
      color yellow and appears as such; the element of the quintessence of 
      warmth transforms into the color red and appears as such; and the element 
      of the quintessence of the breath transforms into the color green, and 
      appears as such. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the lamp of the 
      empty bindu, the five quintessences appear in circular forms, so they are 
      called bindus. Although they are spherical, without corners, in your 
      vision they appear like concentric circles due to throwing a stone in a 
      pond. The interior of the so-called hollow crystal kati channel is filled 
      with the lights of the five quintessences, and a form of an indestructible 
      bindu is present in that space. By gazing at that with the eye of wisdom, 
      the interior of that channel becomes evident and arises in the form of 
      outer appearances. Without grasping onto them, your own channels will 
      illuminate themselves. If you grasp [427] onto the visions of the absolute 
      nature as being external and onto awareness as being internal, you will 
      fall into the error of dualistic grasping. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In the domain of that 
      pristine, absolute nature, the lusters of awareness called vajra-strands 
      appear like moving, floating threads of gold. That is the initial phase. 
      After awhile they appear like pearls threaded on a string, and finally 
      they emerge in the form of full and half-lattices. They are the basis from 
      which the two kinds of lamps of vital essence arise, called the lamp of 
      self-arisen wisdom and the self-knowing sugatagarbha.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The four lamps of the

      The four lamps of the contemplative path are combined in one. Know that 
      synthesizing them, then applying yourself to practice is of the utmost 
      importance. If you practice in that way, unlike the mentally constructed, 
      vague meditation as in the Breakthrough--the reality-itself of the clear 
      light will directly appear to your senses, so they are called the direct 
      visions of reality-itself. This is not like [428] meditating on 
      substantial, human- like deities that are strenuously conjured up by the 
      mind, as in the stage of generation. This alone is the practical 
      instruction for achieving stability in the great experiential displays of 
      the embodiments and primordial wisdoms, thereby liberating the actual 
      three embodiments within yourself. This is superior to the ordinary kinds 
      of transference involving the three recognitions, 73 a path by which you 
      visualize shapes and colors and propel yourself aloft, as it were. This 
      has the distinction of the great transference by which you transform all 
      appearances and mental states of samsara and nirvana into the absolute 
      nature of reality-itself. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Due to continuously 
      practicing single-pointedly in that way, the potency of the vase 
      empowerment strikes the materiality of your body, so that you have no wish 
      to move your body; due to the potency of the secret empowerment permeating 
      your speech patterns, you have no wish to speak; and due to the potency of 
      the wisdom empowerment striking your mental continuum, your attention 
      remains wherever you place it. This is real quiescence that is devoid of 
      signs. Thus, since all coarse and subtle ideation is calmed in the ocean 
      of the original ground, it is quiescent; and since awareness remains 
      without fluctuation in its own state, it is still.74</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">By transforming 
      appearances and mental states into displays of the embodiments and 
      primordial wisdoms, [429] there is an exceptional vision of the

      as one's destination. <br>

      since you truly know the reality-itself of the Breakthrough, the nature of 
      existence of suchness, you see the truth of reality-itself. Due to 
      achieving a great, unprecedented vision of reality-itself, this is the 
      Very Joyful [ground]. With the first visions of the Leap-over, you come to 
      the confidence of never returning to samsara, so you implicitly achieve 
      the first ground of the sutra path. On the mantra path, all delusive 
      appearances and mental states come to maturation in the nature of the 
      clear light, reality-itself; ignorance is transformed into awareness, and 
      you implicitly achieve the ground in which awareness holds its own ground. 
      At this time, even if you die and are interrupted [in your practice], you 
      will be reborn as a tulku, and you will have embarked on the path of 
      liberation. The outer signs are that the appearances of the absolute 
      nature are majestic and stable, as if the curtain on them had been opened; 
      and bindus appear, ranging from the size of fish eyes to thumb rings.

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This is the way the 
      experiential visions progress. Initially, vital energy fills you inside 
      from your heart up to your throat, or various sorts of illnesses or 
      disagreeable pains may occur. [430] Randomly moving throughout the 
      exterior and interior of your body, staying in no one place for long, 
      these disturbances arise due to the potency of the vital energy of 
      primordial wisdom striking the ascending wind. After awhile, they increase 
      and your throat may become sore and blocked so that food is obstructed and 
      coughed out. You may lose your appetite, have trouble breathing, and lose 
      your voice. Then they increase yet further, and disturbances arise due to 
      the potency of the vital energy of primordial wisdom striking the 
      life-sustaining wind. Then you may experience mood swings from joy to 
      sorrow and from desire to hatred. Due to the potency of the vital energy 
      of primordial wisdom striking the descending wind, when the disturbances 
      increase, urine and excrement are blocked and cannot be excreted, and when 
      the disturbances subside, they are expelled constantly. Due to the&nbsp; </font>

      energy of primordial wisdom striking the pervasive wind, when those 
      disturbances increase, the body becomes swollen, and when they decrease, 
      all the flesh of your body withers as if it were becoming a corpse. Due to 
      the potency of the vital energy of primordial wisdom striking the fire 
      accompanying wind, when the disturbances increase, sweat emerges from the 
      body and great heat arises; [431] and when they subside, you get goose 
      bumps, your complexion deteriorates, and you shiver with cold. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Finally, all the winds 
      combine and enter the channels and elements of the body, and sharp pains 
      arise in all the channels. Movements of the winds permeate your whole 
      body, inside and outside, giving rise to various illnesses such as 
      combined heat and cold disorders. The body becomes swollen, boils and 
      sores appear, dire illnesses arise, medications and divinations go awry, 
      bad omens appear, and individual channels and joints become painful. 
      Gout,&nbsp; rheumatoid arthritis, and lymph disorders may arise, and you may 
      become lame, blind, deaf, or mute, and may pass out. Know that various 
      random kinds of pains may arise in the body.</font></p>

      someone afflicted with a disease. In short, know fully well that due to 
      the functions of the channels, winds, and elements, these bodily pains 
      will not be the same for everyone, so there is no one criterion for 
      recognizing them. [432] </font></p>
