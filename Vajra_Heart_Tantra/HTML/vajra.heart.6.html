      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">These crucial points 
      are the unsurpassed field of experience of people who directly see the 
      mode of existence of reality-itself. All the acts of offering and giving 
      on the part of those who do not know that are nothing more than children's 
      games; and they will not succeed in their true aims. [151] Thus, you, who 
      are like an illusionist, project an illusion- like feast of sensory 
      objects and enjoyments to the recipients of those offerings and gifts, who 
      are like the illusionist's audience. The recipients of those offerings and 
      gifts are pleased, and finally the illusory artifice dissolves into the 
      absolute nature. Likewise, the agent, act, and object of the act are 
      expansively left in the nonobjective absolute nature. That is the samadhi 
      of reality-itself manifesting as illusions. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The causal collection 
      of merit is accumulated by mental cognition, and the resultant great 
      collection of knowledge perfectly manifests as awareness. Thus, without 
      mental projection, the collection of merit is not perfected, so that is 
      something that does not please the recipients of the offerings. Even if 
      one dedicates something as a ransom to demons or as something to help the 
      deceased, the debt is not paid off, for it is impossible to dispel the 
      various torments of suffering. When the demons who are brought into 
      existence from the conceptualizations of grasping onto demons appear as 
      one's enemies, it is as if you kill yourself with your own weapons. 
      Therefore, observe how all ritual activities of subjugating demons, of 
      protecting the living, and guiding the dead are impotent; and recognize 
      the importance of abandoning activities that fail in this and future 
      lives. While contemplatives who realize the nature of reality itself, 
      suchness, [152] strive to accomplish the welfare of themselves and others, 
      they definitely succeed without strain as a result of the powerful 
      blessing of the samadhi of reality-itself playing itself out as 
      illusions.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 102 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Abhasendra then asked, 
      &quot;O Bhagavan, what kind of things are to be known by people who practice 
      the profound Severance of maras? May the Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Abhasendra, the profound wisdom of realizing identitylessness is the 
      so-called object of the Severance of maras. This is what is to be known in 
      that regard: first of all, the causal ignorance of oneself alone obscures 
      one's own face as the dharmakaya. The consciousness of grasping onto the I 
      rises up, then that which is not corporeal appears as a body. The very 
      firm, dense consciousness of such obsessive grasping apprehends that body 
      as oneself, and it devotedly guards that body, and holds onto all manner 
      of hopes, fears, pleasures, and pains. Delusion in the cycle of existence 
      is such that even while merely dreaming one obsessively grasps onto this 
      body and for the sake of its sustenance, pleasure, and beauty one is 
      tightly bound and totally ensnared with various mental states of 
      attachment and hatred. [153] As a result, one is deluded in the endless 
      cycle of existence, and maras, vighnas, pisacas and grahas occur. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Thinking that they are 
      damaging the means for one's bodily survival, fear arises towards one's 
      enemies; due to the appearance of their robbing one of one's possessions 
      and enjoyments, hatred arises towards them. With the appearance of illness 
      and discomfort in one's body, fear arises with respect to demons. With the 
      desire for bodily well-being, hopeful thoughts arise for all good things, 
      and fearing harm to one's body, fear arises towards all bad things. The 
      mind is distressed by the body owing to illness occurring in one's body, 
      the appearances of hunger and thirst in the body, and the arising of heat 
      and cold in the body. Owing to the emergence of pleasurable and painful 
      appearances with respect to the body, the mind is drawn to disagreeable 
      objects and is tormented with suffering. In all one's lifetimes, apart 
      from rare occasions of </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 103 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">unconsciousness, the 
      mind accompanies this defiled, closely held body as if it were its shadow, 
      so the body is the basis for various types of suffering. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">All the hopes that 
      arise for any kind of object [154] are called hopes in good, lofty maras, 
      and all the fears of any kind of object are fears of base, bad maras. 
      Therefore, the foundation of the cycle of existence and the miserable 
      states of existence is obsessive grasping onto one's body. As a technique 
      for Severance of such obsessive grasping, one regards this body as being 
      like a corpse. One looks upon consciousness as the conveyer of that 
      corpse, upon obsessive grasping as the rope by which it is conveyed, upon 
      rugged places as charnel grounds, and upon gods and demons as birds and 
      carnivores. In those five ways one practices generosity. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This is to be known at 
      all times and in every&nbsp; situation: one lives one's life clothing this body 
      with beautiful, warm garments and supplying it with tasty, nutritious 
      food. Towards this end, one takes on hardships, thinks nothing of fatigue, 
      and shoulders the great burden of suffering. While ignoring the causes of 
      eternal joy and their consequences, one strives diligently and without 
      satisfaction. In the end, the flesh between one's skin and bones withers 
      away; one's skin becomes covered with wrinkles; one's legs and arms become 
      like sticks; one's complexion deteriorates, and one takes on the color of 
      a rotten, moldy corpse; one's chest and spine become crooked like steps on 
      a stairway; [155] one's black hair becomes white; one's teeth fall out and 
      the mouth caves in; the eyes grow dim and one cannot see one's way; it 
      becomes difficult to get up, as if one were hoisting a corpse; it becomes 
      difficult to sit still, as if&nbsp; one were carrying a burden; one's 
      intestines rumble due to indigestion; and one needs to urinate frequently 
      so that one cannot quench one's thirst. Disturbed by a blizzard-like din 
      of all such pains and miseries, there will come a time when not an iota of 
      joy remains. Then this body cannot be sustained even with care, and it 
      cannot be&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">protected. Repeatedly 
      ponder the pointlessness of striving for the sake of this body.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In general, pisacas 
      are devourers, for they consume the fruits of omniscience; and vadhakas 
      are murderers, for they present the appearances of birth and death within 
      the cycle of existence. They cut off one's vitality, for they sever the 
      artery of liberation; and they take away one's breath, for they steal the 
      breath of happiness. The myriad pisacas of mundane existence are so 
      called, for they make the cycle of existence that has not come into being 
      come into being. The ten grahas are so called, for they torment one in 
      lifetime after lifetime. The harinis are so called, for they steal away 
      the collections of merit and knowledge. Nagas, grahas, and ksamapatis are 
      the delusions produced by the causes and conditions of ignorance. Male 
      grahas, parthivas, and vigrahas are apparitions of hatred toward other 
      objects. Female grahas and pisacas are apparitions of attachment toward 
      sensually pleasant phenomena. [156] The 80,000 types of vighnas are so 
      called because they obstruct the path to liberation. Village pisacas and 
      village gyuks are so called because they dwell in the village of the five 
      aggregates. Seraks are so called, for they have no contentment or 
      satisfaction. Damsis are so called, for they cause one to transgress one's 
      samayas. All grahas, vighnas, vinayakas, and bhutas are assembled in this 
      very body, and they do not exist anywhere else. Upon examining this 
      condition, sever obsessive grasping; and in order to counteract such 
      craving, recognize the importance of applying yourself to giving away your 
      body. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for recognizing the 
      body, inwardly it is a defiled, closely held illusory body; in-between it 
      is an illusory body of delusive appearances of sensory objects; and 
      externally it is an illusory body of tangible appearances of the elements. 
      The essential nature of all these is emptiness. The conscious awareness 
      that grasps onto that which is empty as being real is the mind, so the

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">mind is sent to the 
      absolute nature.27 The reality [of this body] is transformed into a 
      corpse, then the self, the agent who does that, is recognized as being 
      like an illusionist. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The body is 
      transformed into desirable offerings as in an illusory feast, while the 
      recipients of this offering are recognized as being like an illusory, 
      projected crowd. As for the white offerings, [the corpse] is transformed 
      into a mound of the three white offerings and the three sweet offerings 
      and is then offered. As for the multi-colored offerings, [the corpse] is 
      imagined as a splendid array of various desirable things and is then 
      offered. [157] As for the red offerings, [the corpse] is imagined as 
      flesh, blood, bones, marrow, and fat and is then offered. As for the black 
      offerings, [the corpse] is imagined as black fluid to purify illnesses, 
      grahas, vices, obscurations. Those offerings are prepared and presented on 
      the four occasions. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">At all times and in 
      all situations relentlessly dismiss all the anxieties and worries of your 
      mind. Force yourself to hope for all undesired illnesses and miseries and 
      rejoice in them. It is crucial to train earnestly in the attitude of 
      taking the sufferings of others upon yourself and giving them your 
      happiness. In general, go to all places inhabited by demons, and there 
      strive in the crucial task of forcefully arousing ideation. While 
      externally manifesting gods and demons have never existed, when gods and 
      demons created by ideation appear, or when their apparitions appear, 
      rejoice as if you were a vulture who has come upon someone dismembering a 
      corpse. When internally manifesting pains and diseases occur in your body, 
      rejoice as if you were a beggar who has obtained food and wealth, and 
      think and say, 'May many more such things continue to happen!' [158] 
      Moreover, if secretly manifesting pleasurable and delightful appearances 
      occur to your mind, immediately sever attachment and craving; and </font>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">27 That, is the mind 
      is separated from the body and departs in the form of a primordial wisdom 
      dakini.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page106 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">as soon as any sort of 
      suffering and unhappiness occurs, sever hope and fear and cultivate a 
      sense of good cheer. The most essential point is to wish, with a sense of 
      sheer abandon, 'May someone take this body away!' Know that those are the 
      three types of practices for all external, internal, and secret events.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Consider, 'When this 
      body turns into a corpse, whether it is incinerated, thrown into a river, 
      or buried underground, all my efforts and all the difficulties I have 
      undergone on its behalf will be in vain. What a great waste! It is best to 
      give away this body, which is the most prized thing in this world. Now why 
      couldn't I disengage from this basis of the cycle of existence and the 
      miserable states of existence and proceed to the citadel of great 
      liberation!' In that way apply yourself to the profound practice of the 
      Severance of maras. If you do not properly comprehend this critical point, 
      the practice called Severance will be nothing more than an oral recitation 
      and noise-making with a damaru and bell. First of all, correctly establish 
      and realize the nature of profound emptiness, which is the basis of 
      Severance. This is something you must know. [159] The culmination of the 
      practice is coming upon the perfect nature of the whole of samsara and 
      nirvana in the absolute nature of pristine space. That is the ultimate, 
      supreme goal. The Tantra of the Profound Discipline of the Severance of 
      Maras is none other than this.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Vidyavajra rose from his seat and said to the Bhagavan, &quot;O Teacher, 
      Bhagavan, how excellent! Is it true or not that simply by knowing one's 
      own nature, called the Great Perfection of empty awareness, knowing that 
      all the phenomena in the universe are by nature not established, and 
      knowing their empty status and origination, one ascertains this yana? May 
      the Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, knowing the way of emptiness in which all phenomena are by 
      nature not established is the great, universal foundation of all the yanas, 
      and it does not pertain to one yana alone. All meditations performed by 
      those who do not know this may constitute mental virtue, but such 
      meditations do not bring them even a hair's breadth closer to the path of 
      liberation. Therefore, the revelation that all phenomena, from form up to 
      the omniscient mind, are emptiness [160] is the sublime quintessence of 
      the teachings of all the jinas, and it is called the universal foundation 
      of all the yanas, That view is the indispensable, great, fundamental 
      ground of all the paths. Due to the specific path that accord with the 
      faculties of superior, middling, and inferior individuals--which, in turn, 
      are due to their metabolisms and the functioning of their senses--many 
      sorts of yanas are revealed. Correctly know the manner in which the Great 
      Perfection is the ground and result of all yanas, and come to the nature 
      of reality. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This is its mode of 
      being: it is the great, rootless, and groundless, the pervasive realm of 
      space, and the nonobjective, unobstructed display. It is the great 
      reality, primordially free of all flaws, contaminations, and habitual 
      propensities. In terms of external objects, there is no buddha other than 
      that. Taking into account the many, vast, inconceivable buddhas throughout 
      the full extent of space, if all their primordial wisdoms and excellent 
      qualities were to be </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 108 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">applied to improve 
      this ground, they would not enhance it in the slightest. Why? Because 
      there is no object to be enhanced. [161] Look at the unobstructed space of 
      the dharmakaya, in which, from times past, the buddhas have not wandered 
      within the cycle of existence. Except for delusive appearances of that 
      which is not existent appearing to be existent, not a single sentient 
      being exists. In terms of the infinite, limitless sentient beings 
      throughout the full extent of space, even if all their vices, 
      obscurations, and miseries were assembled and used to impair the realm of 
      space of the primordial ground, see that not even an iota of harm would be 
      inflicted, for that object is not established. Due to grasping 
      consciousness, the cycle of existence merely appears but is not 
      established, while the ground is primordially pure and untainted by flaws, 
      so it is unwavering. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">First of all, by 
      examining the location of birth and the one who is born, one ascertains 
      that they do not apply to the past, nor to the future, nor is there any 
      birth in the present either.28 The one who is born and the location do not 
      exist anywhere, so there is freedom from the extremes of birth. Likewise, 
      cessation is not apprehended in the past or the future, nor does it exist 
      in the present. The one who has ceased is also seen to be nonobjective, so 
      there is freedom from the extreme of cessation. Discontinuity is either 
      nothing, or if it is examined, [162] it is the ground of both the 
      appearance of the impure cycle of existence and all the pure primordial 
      wisdoms and qualities of the buddhas; and since they are groundless, there 
      is freedom from the extreme of discontinuity. If existent phenomena are 
      analyzed in terms of permanence, that should be directly visible to the 
      eyes and there should ultimately be something to grasp with the hands. But 
      since that is not seen even with the eyes of the jinas, there is freedom 
      from the extreme of permanence. If the destination to which one comes and 
      the one who is coming are examined, they are not in the past,&nbsp; nor in
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">28 This discussion 
      refers to the eight philosophical assertions of birth, cessation, 
      discontinuity, permanence, coming, going, differentiation, and identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page109 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">the future. They 
      should be established with directly verifying cognition in the present, 
      but the agent who comes and the entire envirornment are nonobjective, so 
      there is freedom from the extreme of coming. By examining the destination 
      to which one goes and the one who is going, they, too are not observed in 
      the past or in the future. In the present this directly verifiable entity 
      is seen to be nonobjective, so there is freedom from the extreme of going. 
      To examine the ground in terms of its being differentiated, since all 
      phenomena are, without differentiation, of one taste in the absolute 
      nature of the ground sugatagarbha, there is freedom from the extreme of 
      differentiation. To examine the ground in terms of its unity, all the 
      phenomena included within samsara and nirvana appear individually, with 
      their own unique features, so there is freedom from the extreme of unity.

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As an analogy for 
      those two, if one examines the unimaginable planets and stars appearing in 
      the ocean, [163] not even a single particle of those stars exists apart 
      from the ocean; and, contrary to taking them to be a single entity, they 
      appear individually without blending together. In the same way, recognize 
      that phenomena are free of all philosophical positions. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Due to the fact that 
      all phenomena arising as dependently related events are nonexistent and 
      not established, they are totally free of the eight extremes of conceptual 
      elaboration. If one adopts a position that falls to an extreme, one with 
      factional, errant views has veered immeasurably far away from the state of 
      buddhahood. Such a person wanders around in a daze in the midst of a dark 
      jungle that is far from the path to liberation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">This is the liberation

      signs, and the emptiness of their not being established as real. By 
      examining and analyzing one's own mind internally, it is found to be a 
      nonobjective openness without any ground, pervasive reality-itself without 
      any root, free of all extremes of conceptual elaboration, so that is inner 
      emptiness. By examining the intermediate mode of being of both appearances 
      and the mind, [164] they are found to be not different from the great, 
      nondual, single taste. Appearing from themselves and dissolving into 
      themselves, the mind and appearances are neither conjoined nor separated, 
      so they are emptiness that is devoid of disengagement, and that door of 
      liberation is called emptiness. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Ground-awareness, the 
      great liberation from extremes, cannot be indicated with words, for it 
      transcends the objects of articulation. Nor can it be indicated by 
      analogies, so it is incomparable and transcends factional extremes. It 
      cannot be indicated by referents, so it transcends the conceptual objects 
      of the intellect; and one alights upon reality-itself, the self-arisen 
      nature, primordially at rest, free of clinging onto experience. That is 
      the signless door of liberation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The ground, the 
      mind-itself, the primordial Buddha Samantabhadra, the great, pervasive 
      lord of the whole of samsara and nirvana, knows its own essential nature 
      and is naturally liberated within itself. Thus, whatever is done to 
      enhance this ground by way of the physical, verbal, and mental striving 
      stemming from the natural perfection of the displays of the embodiments 
      and primordial wisdoms, there is not even the slightest trace of benefit. 
      Even if this ground wished to go from this location to some other realm, 
      when one perceives the fact that the great realm of pervasive space is 
      free of all going and coming in the three times, there is certainly not 
      even a yearning for that condition; [165] and that is the desireless door

      Great Perfection.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Bodhisattva 
      Vidyavajra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, if the primordial wisdoms and 
      excellent qualities subsequently arise from this ground, which is 
      originally the dharmakaya, and the nature of Samantabhadra, and if 
      origination and accomplishment do not exist, since all sentient beings are 
      none other than buddhas, how does one distinguish between buddhas and 
      sentient beings? May the Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, at the time of ignorance, the ground becomes ethically 
      neutral, not helped or impaired by excellent qualities, like a drawing of 
      a lamp. Therefore, the delusion of sentient beings is like mistaking a 
      boulder for a deer, mistaking a pile of stones for a human, mistaking a 
      striped rope for a snake, mistaking silver for zinc, mistaking gold for 
      pyrite, and mistaking a gem for an ordinary rock. When one knows the 
      nature of the ground, the primordial great perfection of excellent 
      qualities, one realizes that appearances have no true existence. That is 
      like ascertaining that the boulder is not a deer, [166] like rejecting the 
      apprehension of a mirage as water, like rejecting the apprehension of a 
      pile of stones as a human, and like rejecting the apprehension of a 
      striped rope as a snake. Just as one recognizes those as mistakes, one 
      rejects the delusive clinging of grasping onto reality, and realizes that 
      things are identityless. Then the ascertainment of the ground is 
      nonobjective, great openness is the essential nature of meditation. </font>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The superiority of 
      that over sentient beings is like recognizing gold and silver, so that 
      they become manifest as a treasure; and like the recognition of the gem as 
      a gem after mistaking it for an ordinary rock, this recognition is called 
      the wisdom of realization. Far surpassing sentient beings, it rots the 
      seed of mundane existence. To give analogies of the destruction of mundane

      Vidyavajra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, can one become a buddha simply by 
      knowing that mode of being of the ground, without needing to meditate? May 
      the Teacher explain!&quot; [167]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, if one does not know the mode of existence of the ground, one 
      will not become enlightened. Therefore, the body of knowledge of the 
      intermediate teachings, namely the so-called Dharma Without 
      Characteristics, reveal that all phenomena, ranging from form up to 
      omniscience, are emptiness. Without knowing that, one will not be 
      liberated. Therefore, the 6,400,000 sets of tantras of the Great 
      Perfection were revealed. Be aware that if one could become enlightened 
      without needing to know that, there would be no need for those teachings.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Even if one knows the 
      emptiness of one's own mind but does not know the emptiness of the entire 
      animate and inanimate universe, with its three realms, one has not 
      realized anything more than personal identitylessness; so one has not 
      surpassed the Sravakayana. Even if one knows that the entire animate and 
      inanimate universe is empty from its own side, if one does not deduce its 
      essential nature as emptiness and know the ground to be emptiness, then 
      emptiness is reduced to something ethically neutral, and no benefit is 
      derived. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Even if one knows it 
      to be emptiness, one might think that emptiness has<br>
      no good or bad qualities and that excellent qualities and enlightened 
      activity must stem from somewhere else. Understanding emptiness to be the 
      emptiness of a vessel, and excellent qualities and enlightened activity to 
      be its contents, [168] one might assert that enlightened activity from 
      somewhere else enters into it. In that case, some other rich proprietor of 
      enlightened activity, a donor who </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 113</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">fills up that vessel, 
      would have to exist somewhere else, so if it were possible for the Buddha 
      of that place to exist as something permanent, stable, and immutable, he 
      would not be empty. And if emptiness were an emptiness of matter, with no 
      good or bad qualities, this would falsely imply that all the phenomena of 
      the animate and inanimate universe, with its sensory objects appearing 
      everywhere in this life, during the dream-state and following this life 
      would be self-arisen and self-sufficient; and the appearances and mind of 
      the cycle of existence would be established. When one knows the nature of 
      this and achieves penetration, appearances manifest as displays of the 
      embodiments and primordial wisdoms. Due to that transmutation, the state 
      of buddhahood becomes manifest and the aspects of its excellent qualities 
      are naturally perfected. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">There may be many 
      people who apprehend space as an emptiness of materiality without any good 
      or bad qualities. Nevertheless, since space is the ground and essential 
      nature of the five elements and the various sensory objects, what reason 
      compels one to assert it to be an emptiness of materiality with no good or 
      bad qualities? There are no appearing objects other than space; and if one 
      grasps onto space as something substantial, there is no point in asserting 
      samsara and nirvana to be great emptiness. [169] If there were something 
      on which to meditate other than the manifestations of the realm of 
      pervasive space, what is the point of speaking of no meditation, no 
      referent,. and no grasping? The essential nature of the subject of 
      meditation is emptiness, and if that is not recognized, one's meditation 
      with no view is reduced to something ethically neutral. So how could that 
      possibly be genuine meditation? </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">If one fails to 
      recognize and understand samsara and nirvana as naturally appearing 
      displays, what is the point of identifying awareness? Establishing that 
      ultimately samsara and nirvana are of the nature of great emptiness, and 
      then </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 114 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">recognizing and 
      ascertaining everything to be of the nature of one space is realization; 
      and just that is the view. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">O Vidyavajra, by 
      knowing that, thoroughly fathoming it, and gaining conviction in that, 
      then earnestly applying oneself to the practice of meditation, finally one 
      reaches the state of liberation; and that is the sublime key to practice. 
      On the other hand, if mere intellectual knowledge were enough, with no 
      need for meditation, then all the yogins, vidyadharas, and mahasiddhas of 
      the past who practiced meditation on the basis of realization while 
      courageously taking on hardships would have been wasting their time. [170] 
      On the contrary , know that it is necessary to apply oneself to the 
      essential practice of meditating on the basis of realization. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The reduction of the 
      inwardly present ground to something ethically neutral is like the sky 
      covered with darkness, while manifest ground- awareness is like the dawn 
      breaking and the sun rising. Ignorance of the ground is like having no 
      master for the entire realm of a great king. Identifying manifest 
      awareness for oneself is like a poor person without any status or 
      possessions being enthroned as a king and enjoying royal privileges. Like 
      a wealthy person imprisoned by a king or an enemy, who suffers from 
      starvation, thirst, torture, and terrible surroundings for a long time, 
      one experiences endless suffering in the cycle of existence due to the 
      obscuration by dualistic grasping and ignorance of the ground, the 
      primordial Great Perfection. Finally identifying awareness so that it 
      becomes manifest is like that person being freed from prison, dwelling in 
      his own home, and enjoying joy and happiness. Awareness is far, far 
      superior to an ethically neutral ground.&nbsp; [171] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Here is an analogy for 
      the presence of the ground as something ethically neutral. Imagine that a 
      person is afflicted with a disease, and right under his bed </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 115 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">is a medicine endowed 
      with eight qualities.29 But since he does not recognize it, he is 
      tormented for a long time by his terrible illness. Then after some time he 
      recognizes it as a healing medicine, eats it, and consequently his disease 
      is cured and he is brought to good health. Similarly, once one has truly 
      realized the mode of existence of the ground, manifest awareness 
      apprehends its own state for itself. Consequently, the great, chronic 
      disease of the cycle of existence is cleared out altogether, and one is 
      brought to a state of eternal bliss.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Even if one has 
      identified awareness that is present as the ground, there is no benefit if 
      one does not practice. As an analogy, even if one has gold in hand, if one 
      does not trade it for something that could help with food and clothing, 
      but rather uses the gold as a pillow, one would die of starvation and 
      exposure to the elements. Likewise, reducing the awareness that has been 
      identified to something ethically neutral is just like that. Even if one 
      recognizes a wish fulfilling jewel for what it is, no siddhis are granted 
      if one does not treat it with respect. Reducing the awareness that has 
      been identified to something ethically<br>
      neutral is just like that. Even if one has beautiful, warm clothing, if 
      one does not wear it, one will die from the cold and wind. Reducing the 
      awareness that has been identified to something ethically neutral is just 
      like that. [172] Even if one lives in a home with plenty of food, one 
      would die of starvation if one did not eat it. Reducing the awareness that 
      has been identified to something ethically neutral is just like that. Know 
      the crucial importance of practicing after one has acquired knowledge and 
      realization.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Bodhisattva 
      Vidyavajra then asked, &quot;O Teacher Bhagavan, so it is. Is there any 
      difference between a deluded individual who has identified awareness and 
      one who has not?&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">29 The Tibetan medical 
      tradition normally speaks of seventeen qualities (Tib, yon tan bcu bdun) 
      of medicine, so this reference to the eight qualities presumably refers to 
      the eight potencies (Tib, nus pa) of medicine, namely, heavy, oily, mild, 
      sharp, light, rough, hot, and cool. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 116 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of 
      good breeding, there is no difference between one person who knows the 
      route taking the wrong trail and another person who does not know the 
      route taking the wrong trail. There is no difference between being robbed 
      by an enemy one knows and being robbed by an enemy who is a stranger. 
      There is no difference between one person who knows of the presence of a 
      cliff falling over it and another person who does not know of it falling 
      over it. Likewise, there is not even the slightest difference between 
      those two.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Vidyavajra then asked, 
      [173] &quot;Bhagavan, so it is. What is the name of the yana for the knowledge 
      of that reality imbued with all such excellent qualities? May the Teacher 
      explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, the ground-sugatagarbha cannot be improved, nor can it be 
      impaired by bad sentient beings. It is free of the eight extremes of 
      conceptual elaborations, it is imbued with the three doors of liberation, 
      and it is the natural perfection of all the displays of the embodiments 
      and primordial wisdoms. Knowledge of this truth and the reasons for it 
      constitutes realization, and that distinguishes its superiority over other 
      yanas. Knowing by means of other yanas that the ground is empty is a 
      commonly shared field of experience, but this Spirit of Perfect Awakening 
      is a supreme distinction of this swift path. This is called the Ultimate 
      Spirit of Awakening or the Supreme Yana of the Profound, Mysterious, 
      Fruitional Great Perfection. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Vidyavajra then asked, 
      &quot;What is the nature of the embodiments and primordial wisdoms? May the 
      Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, [174] &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, the embodiments are like this. Many avenues of accumulating 
      merit arise as appearances to deluded sentient beings. To take an example, 
      in making prostrations, getting up and lying down are not the accumulation 
      of merit. Rather, masses of merit are introduced by the faith and 
      reverence of the consciousness of prostrating and the idea that 
      prostrating is </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 117 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">virtuous. Knowing that 
      fact is an aspect of the sugatagarbha, so that is the avenue for the 
      generation of masses of merit. Taking steps in performing a 
      circumambulation is not the accumulation of merit. Rather the very 
      consciousness of circumambulating is an aspect of the sugatagatbha, so 
      that is the avenue for the generation of masses of merit. As for making 
      saccha images and constructing stupas, making forms of clay and stone is 
      not the accumulation of merit. Rather, the very discernment of performing 
      virtue is an aspect of the sugatagarbha, so that is the avenue for the 
      generation of masses of merit. In offering butter-lamps, burning butter is 
      not the accumulation of merit. Rather, the very discernment of making an 
      offering is a facet of the sugatagarbha, so that is the avenue for the 
      generation of masses of merit. [175] In making water offerings, filling a 
      bowl with water is not the accumulation of merit. Rather, the very 
      discernment of offering the bowls of water generates merit, so that is the 
      avenue. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Whatever offerings are 
      made, there is no real being who partakes of them, so if there were a 
      direct, valid perception of one being present there, that would not 
      constitute the accumulation of merit. But the discernment that generates 
      virtuous merit acts as a cause for merely temporary, agreeable conditions 
      in the future and for a sense of happiness arising in one's mind. As for 
      verbal recitations, the mere utterance of syllables is not a cause of 
      merit. Rather, the virtuous consciousness of one's intention is an aspect 
      of the ground, so the result is also produced by that. The avenue for 
      those is reality-itself, one's own primordial awareness. As an analogy, if 
      one scoops up some water from a great ocean and says, 'This is the ocean,' 
      it is not in fact the ocean itself, but an aspect of the ocean; yet it is 
      also not water from something other than the ocean. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Likewise, practices of 
      generosity are sentient beings' entrances to the path as a means of 
      generating a little temporary happiness; [176] and those are </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 118 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">creative expressions 
      of reality-itself. As an analogy, one may dream of seeing a beautiful 
      temple with a fine assortment of images representing the body of the 
      Buddha, various letters representing the speech of the Buddha, and 
      representations of the mind of the Buddha, such as stupas, vajras, and 
      kilas. And one may then dream of prostrating to them, making offerings to 
      them, circumambulating them, and so on. When one awakes, if one thinks, 
      'That certainly was done,' one generates an immeasurable mass of merit.&quot;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Vidyavajra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, if virtuous karma occurs due to 
      the functioning of one's intention, by transforming that into the 
      spiritual path as virtue, if one performs actions such as the ten 
      nonvirtues, might that also turn into virtue, or not? May the Bhagavan 
      explain!&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, for all nonvirtuous actions, such as having the basis of 
      recognizing someone as a sentient being, the intention of bringing forth 
      merit, the enactment of attacking someone's life, and the culmination of 
      taking that being's life, there is one's own intentional consciousness and 
      the subliminal consciousness of the appearance of someone else. [177] 
      Nonvirtuous karma is produced from those, and that nonvirtue does not 
      become virtue simply by imagining it to be so. All virtues and vices are 
      not merely due to conceptualization. Know that the basis is knowledge, so 
      joy and sorrow are produced solely by its functioning.&quot;30</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Bodhisattva Vidyavajra 
      then asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, thus, since every single thought is an 
      aspect of the sugatagalbha, I understand that thoughts are the cause of 
      merit, which produces happiness, and also the cause of&nbsp; suffering. 
      Therefore, please show how they are distinguished.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">30 The point here is 
      that knowledge of the nature and object of one's act is crucial in 
      determining whether one's action bears the karmic consequences of joy or 
      sorrow.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">31 Every thought is an 
      aspect of the sugatagarbha if one recognizes its essential nature; 
      otherwise it is simply an aspect of the cycle of existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 119 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, even though every single thought is a facet of the 
      sugatagarbha, one's subliminal ground-consciousness is aroused as one's 
      motivation, and consequences are brought to fruition according to the 
      appearances of the actions taken. Thus, the occurrences of pleasant 
      appearances, miserable appearances, indifferent appearances and so forth 
      are cast up solely by one's good and bad motivations. The fact that 
      hot-tasting fruit ripens from hot tasting seeds, bitter fruit from bitter 
      seeds, and sweet fruit from sweet seeds is due to those fruits being 
      produced by their causal seeds. [178] If [thoughts] were not aspects of 
      the sugatagarbha, there would be no way actions could ripen into their 
      consequences. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Even though pleasant 
      appearances arise, they do not endure, but are merely temporary , so they 
      have no essence. Experiences of suffering, too, do not endure, but are 
      experienced only for awhile, and the appearances of such experiences are 
      like dreams. With respect to those who accumulate bad karma, the 
      accumulation of&nbsp; the causal bad karma, which is their route, may give rise 
      to temporary pleasure, but in the end, suffering arises. With respect to 
      those who accumulate good karma, by accumulating good karma, which is 
      their route, they may willingly take on temporary suffering of hardships 
      and so on; but the fruition of that is the emergence of joyful appearances 
      of the fortunate realms of existence; and when the experience of them 
      comes to an end, such beings continue on from one cycle of existence to 
      another, and they must experience suffering. Due to the very ignorance 
      that obscures one's own nature as&nbsp; the ground, all joys and sorrows and 
      good and bad karma are accumulated as causes of the cycle of existence; so 
      the grounds and paths of liberation are obscured. Therefore, by diligently 
      applying themselves to sustaining their attention, people who practice 
      meditation ascertain all manner of pleasurable and painful sensations with 
      a single grasping consciousness.&quot; [179] </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 120 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The Bodhisattva 
      Vidyavajra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, in terms of causal good and bad 
      deeds and their consequences, is there any difference as far as their 
      obscuring one's own nature as the ground is concerned? May the Teacher 
      explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, to accumulate good karma is to accumulate merit in the cycle 
      of existence. To accumulate bad karma is to store causes of the cycle of 
      existence. Both of them contribute to the cycle of existence, so there is 
      no difference in terms of their obscuring the nature of reality-itself. As 
      an analogy, both a white cloud and a black cloud obscure the rising of the 
      sun in the sky. There is no difference in that regard, for in both cases 
      the face of the sun becomes hidden. Likewise, there is no difference in 
      the obscuration of the natural potency of the ground by virtue and vice, 
      so they conceal the grounds and paths to omniscience. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Whatever one 
      experiences of joy and sorrow, that has never existed in an ultimate 
      sense, so it certainly does not help or harm one in the slightest. Upon 
      careful examination, if one ascertains that joy and sorrow are not 
      established, it may occur to one, 'What harm is there in something that is 
      nonexistent and merely appears to exist?' [180] There is no difference 
      between that and the experience of suffering that arises in a dream, which 
      in fact is not established in reality at all. In the same way, there is no 
      difference between one's satisfaction from pleasure and unbearable pain.&quot;
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Then Bodhisattva 
      Vidyavajra asked, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, if buddhas and sentient beings and 
      all qualities of the path and fruition are none other than the ground-dharmakaya, 
      the sugatagarbha, what is the purpose and the nature of the teachings on 
      the many sadhanas, mandalas, buddha-fields, Teachers and their retinues 
      and so forth? Please explain how this is!&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 121 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O 
      Vidyavajra, in order for the nature of the ground- sugatagarbha to be made 
      manifest, one may strive in various ways to fabricate and transform things 
      with one's intellect. Consequently, all contrived experiences of bliss, 
      clarity, and nonconceptuality, of attentional dispersion, excitation, and 
      scattering, of laxity , dullness, and torpor, and of pains, joys, and 
      sorrows are forcefully aroused until finally all thoughts are calmed in 
      the nature of the ground, and primordially present consciousness is 
      identified. Such meditation entails transforming the nirmanakaya into the 
      path, in which the state of naturally settled mindfulness is sustained. 
      Nowadays everyone regards this as their common practice, [181] but there 
      is the problem that one does not attain the fruition of liberation. Thus, 
      once one has determined the view, the nature of the ground-Samantabhadra 
      must be made manifest; so there is both the direct identification of that 
      for oneself and the identification of that in dependence upon the 
      expedient path of the stage of generation. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">O Vidyavajra, as for 
      the direct identification for oneself, one first establishes all the 
      phenomena&nbsp; included in samsara and nirvana as emptiness. Once one has 
      ascertained them as displays of the space of reality-itself, one sustains 
      the identification for oneself of the great manifestation of that state. 
      As a result, one naturally settles in ground- awareness as the great 
      freedom from extremes. That is the swift path, the spiritual vehicle of 
      the Great Perfection. If one practices by resting naturally and 
      effortlessly until the culmination of the dying process, one will 
      unquestionably become a buddha. On the other hand, if, due to the power of 
      past, bad karma one falls under the influence of distractions&nbsp; and 
      spiritual sloth, at the point of death one dies as an ordinary being.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Due to being deceived 
      by maras, some people appear to have experiences of the taste of mere talk 
      and human words. Clinging to that with attachment, they become addicted to 
      amusements, and waste their lives in chatter that </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 122 </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">accomplishes nothing. 
      [182] Unable to meditate, at the time of death they die as ordinary 
      beings. Some people fill their minds with desires for greatness in this 
      life, for fame,&nbsp; elevated self-esteem, high visibility, and with 
      self-praise. Wasting their lives in performing magic rituals, they, too, 
      die as ordinary beings. Even when their health is failing, they are struck 
      by compounded illnesses, and they are of an age when their lives are 
      almost over, some people still burden their minds with desires for 
      personal greatness, fame, and so on. Having disregarded meditative 
      practice as if it were a clot of spittle, at the time of death they are 
      more pathetic than ordinary beings; and they are compelled to die in 
      misery. Others who crave experiences apply themselves solely to the domain 
      of the intellect. Since they are not satisfied with and do not trust the 
      view and meditation that are effortless and disengaged from activity, they 
      do not practice that. Some people identify [awareness], but since they do 
      not believe in it, they do not practice. Some are satisfied merely with 
      identifying [awareness], and they do not progress beyond that 
      understanding. Some people maintain a false understanding of the meaning, 
      and they are deluded due to negligence. Such sentient beings who lack 
      fortunate karma are very difficult to lead onto the ultimate, effortless 
      path. Therefore, in reliance upon the conventional, effortful path, as a 
      means to leading beings to the ultimate, effortless, absolute nature, 
      [183] the embodiments and primordial wisdoms of the ground- sugatagarbha 
      are fabricated as signs; and many sadhanas involving visualizations and 
      recitations are taught in accordance with the many accounts of the names 
      and referents of deities to be actualized, buddha-fields, palaces, 
      Teachers and their retinues. All accounts stating that by striving in 
      meditative practice one will reach some vast region somewhere out there 
      called a buddha-field are called paths of expedient means. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">All the jinas and 
      jinaputras of the three times are taught to be included among the displays 
      of the five embodiments,32 the five classes of buddhas, and the five 
      primordial wisdoms. Moreover, they do not exist as self-defining objects. 
      Rather, taking all the primordial wisdoms and qualities of the realm of 
      the ground-sugatagarbha as the basis, the teachings for the sake of 
      disciples consist of [1] the signless dharmakaya which is the ultimate, or 
      definitive, meaning, and [2] discussions of names and self-defining 
      objects, in which one is trapped in the cage of signs, and those are the 
      conventional, or provisional, meaning.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">First of all, the 
      explanation of the five embodiments is as follows: all kinds of phenomena 
      that appear as various subjects are of one taste in reality- itself, 
      emptiness, so that is called Dharma. It is called kaya, [184] for it is 
      like an accumulation, or aggregation, of inconceivable entrances to the 
      path, of inconceivable experiences, and of inconceivable fruitional 
      accomplishments stemming from the inconceivable array of specific 
      metabolisms and faculties [of sentient beings]. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">With respect to 
      sentient beings' obscurations due to ignorance, karma, and mental 
      afflictions, from the very time that the ego-grasping consciousness 
      arises, all appearances of the dream-state, the waking- state, future 
      lifetimes, and the entire animate and inanimate universe, with all its 
      sensory objects were not created by activities or brought about by effort. 
      Rather, they are naturally completed as one's domain of experience. 
      Likewise, at the time of buddhahood as well, purification, liberation, and 
      all the displays of the embodiments and primordial wisdoms are not created 
      by activities or accomplished by effort. Rather, they are naturally 
      completed as one's domain of experience. For that reason they are called 
      the sambhogakaya. </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">32 The following

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The mind has never 
      been activated and is not activated by thinking, 'I shall send forth 
      emanations from the state of the ground-sugatagarbha.' Emanations have 
      never been intentionally emanated, so they are not emanated. Just as the 
      planets and stars in the ocean are not other than the ocean, so do all 
      appearances of samsara and nirvana naturally arise as various emanations 
      that are not other than the sugatagarbha itself. For that reason they are 
      called the nirmanakaya.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As soon as there is 
      the conscious sense of ego-grasping, there is no way one's body cannot 
      appear. Thus, [185] in all dream appearances, waking appearances, and 
      appearances following this life, the self arises from thoughts of 
      ego-grasping; and experienced objects, various types of living beings 
      going through the processes of birth and death, and moving about appear as 
      one's companions in an unceasing stream. All those appearances are called 
      living being nirmanakayas.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">For disciples who have 
      the karma of being suitable vessels, the various avenues of accumulating 
      merit in accordance with one's own metabolism and faculties, the various 
      stages of the path, the various rupakayas that accord with one's own form, 
      language, and conduct, and spiritual mentors, teachers, writings and so 
      forth that train disciples are emanations of one's own sugatagarbha. So 
      those teachers who reveal the path to us are called teacher nirmanakayas.</font></p>

      the speech of enlightened beings such as various letters, manuscripts, and 
      books, and representations of the mind of enlightened beings such as 
      stupas, kilas, and meteorite vajras are objects of devotions such as 
      prostrations, offerings, and circumambulations. Those appearances as 
      fields for accumulating merit [186] are not due to patrons or artisans, 
      Rather, emanations </font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Objects for the use of 
      the mere appearance of the self include an inconceivable array of

      clothing, ornaments, household goods, bedding, food, drink, earth, water, 
      fire, and air, houses, grass, trees, stones, iron, copper, silver, gold, 
      and brass. Such types of mindless, nonconscious appearing phenomena are 
      material nirmanakayas. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Those four types of 
      nirmanakayas are emanations of the sugatagarbha that naturally arise in 
      the objective field of ego-grasping consciousness. As an analogy, they are 
      appearances like the arising of heavenly bodies in a vessel of water, 
      which originate in dependence upon a simultaneous configuration of causes 
      and contributing conditions. Thus, until the self-grasping on the part of 
      disciples disappears into the absolute nature, a continuous stream of 
      nirmanakayas appears. When self-grasping dissolves into the absolute 
      nature, the purpose of the nirmanakayas is fulfilled, which is like the 
      reflections of planets and stars disappearing back into the heavenly 
      bodies as soon as the water dried up. The appearance of an unbroken stream 
      of nirmanakayas until self-grasping has&nbsp; dissolved into the absolute 
      nature [187] is like the continuous reflections in limpid, clear water 
      until the water dries up. The various kinds of emanations are accumulated 
      like aggregations, so they are called kayas. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">The nonconceptual 
      primordial wisdom of reality-itself is the great reality in which the 
      essence of all sugatagarbhas is unified, and it is the single- taste, 
      absolute nature which is the essential nature of the whole of samsara and 
      nirvana. Thus, it is called the Svabhava, and because it is like an 
      accumulated aggregation of all primordial wisdoms and excellent qualities, 
      it is called kaya. </font></p>
