      here as The Diamond Heart Tantra: A Tantra Naturally Arisen from the
      Nature of Existence from the Matrix of Primordial Awareness of
  Pure Perception[1] is among the principle &quot;mind treasures&quot; of Dudjom Lingpa 
      (1835-1904), one of the great Dzogchen masters of the Nyingma order of 
      Tibetan Buddhism in recent history. Commonly known among Tibetans as 
      Neyluk Rangjung (Naturally Arisen from the Nature of Existence), it is 
      regarded as a general commentary to another of Dudjom Lingpa's great 
      works, Buddhahood Without Meditation: A Visionary Account Known as 
      Refining Apparent Phenomena, which has been beautifully translated into 
      English by Richard Burton under the guidance of Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche.[2]</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Also known as Garwang 
      Dudjom Pawo, Dudjom Lingpa was born in the Golok region of eastern Tibet 
      on the tenth day of the first month of the Sheep Year. According to a 
      number of ancient and recent prophecies, as written by one of his own 
      subsequent emanations, H. H. Dudjom Rinpoche, his previous incarnations 
      include the following masters of the Buddhist tradition:</font></p>

      Lingpa's own autobiography,[3] during the first three years of his life, 
      he saw hosts of dakinis and protective deities looking over him. On one 
      occasion a dakini led him to Oddiyana, the realm of the dakinis, where he 
      encountered Vajravarahi, foremost of the dakinis, from whom he received 
      great blessings. During his youth, he also spent one human day at Palri on 
      the subcontinent of Ngayab (Skt.?), which equalled twelve years in the 
      time of that realm. There he received teachings from Padmasambhava 
      himself. On various occasions he also received prophecies from 
      Padmasambhava's consort Yeshe Tsogyal, who she cared for him her like own 
      son.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Dudjom Lingpa had 
      eight renowned sons, including Jigme Tenpey Nyima, the Third Dodrup Chen 
      Rinpoche (1865-1926), who was a consummate scholar and adept of both the 
      sutras and tantras. During the course of his life, Dudjom Lingpa performed 
      many miracles, and he reached the highest stages of realization of the 
      stages of generation and completion as well as the Great Perfection. It is 
      said that thirteen of his disciples attained the Rainbow Body, and one 
      thousand became vidyadharas through gaining insight into the essential 
      nature of awareness.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Dudjom Lingpa's 
      subsequent incarnations include His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, Jigdral 
      Yeshe Dorje, his mind emanation and the editor of the Tibetan version of 
      the text translated here; Tulku Kunzang Nyima (Tib. sPrul sku kun bzang 
      nyi ma) his speech emanation; Sonam Detsen, his body emanation; Jamyang 
      Natsok Rangdrol, also known as Dorje Dragtsel Lingpa, an emanation of his 
      enlightened activities; and Tulku Drachen (Rahula, sp?), an emanation of 
      his enlightened qualities.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In one of Dudjom 
      Lingpa's dreams, a devaputra named Dunggi Zurphu prophesied that the 
      benefit from his profound hidden treasures would go west, saying, &quot;Those 
      deserving to tamed by you dwell in human cities to the west.&quot; In the hope 
      to help fulfill that prophesy, the present translation of his hidden 
      treasure The Diamond Heart Tantra was made under the guidance of the 
      Venerable Gyatrul Rinpoche, who has been teaching in the west since 1972. 
      Gyatrul Rinpoche received the oral transmission of this text three times 
      from three of the emanations of Dudjom Lingpa: in Tibet he received it 
      from Jamyang Natsok Rangdrol and from Tulku Kunzang Nyima, and later in 
      Nepal he received it from His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche, Jigdral Yeshe 
      Dorje, the Supreme Head of the Nyingma order of Tibetan Buddhism.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">Beginning in the 
      autumn of 1995, I read through this text once with Gyatrul Rinpoche, 
      receiving many points of clarification from him. While working on a 
      first-draft translation, he went through the text with me line- by- line, 
      carefully correcting errors in my translation and elucidating points of 
      lingering uncertainty in my own comprehension of the text. I am deeply 
      grateful to him for opening this treasure to me for the benefit of all 
      those who may read our translation. I am also indebted to Dr. Yeshi 
      Dhonden and Khenpo Tsewang Gyatso for elucidating some points of the text.
