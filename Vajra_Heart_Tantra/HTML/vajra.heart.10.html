      influenced by evil maras and damsis. Even if they were taught Dharma of 
      the Secret Mantra, that would be of no benefit but would rather act as a 
      cause for them to fall into vajra-hell. Thus, it is very secret. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the time, 
      inappropriate occasions for teaching and listening to Dharma are times of:

        <li><font face color="#000066" size="4">walking in the marketplace or in

        engaging in conversation.</font> </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">It is inappropriate to 
      teach Dharma on those occasions. If people gather without faith, they too 
      will fall into hell, so on such inappropriate occasions and to people who 
      are not suitable vessels it is wrong to give teachings even upwind of 
      them. So they should be hidden like stolen property. Thus, that is the 
      solemn, hidden secret. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">In general, the 
      primordially Awakened, undeluded, unfluctuating dharmakaya, the

      as [296] all the planets and stars in the ocean are not other than the 
      ocean and are pervaded by the ocean, all the phenomena of the cycle of 
      existence are pervaded by reality-itself. However, under the influence of 
      ignorance, by nature it remains concealed, so that is the concealed 
      secret. Due to its being imbued with those two great mysteries, [the 
      Secret Mantra] is called secret. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face color="#000066" size="4">All the delusive mind 
      states and appearances of all sentient beings of the three realms are 
      overcome in the absolute nature of awareness, which transcends causality, 
      so [the Secret Mantra] is called mantra. All the intellectual ideologies 
      of the eight yanas are overcome in the state of the dharmakaya, which is 
      free of signs. Since that is the great primordial wisdom of awareness, 
      free of extremes, [the Secret Mantra] is called mantra.53 </font></p>

      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As it is endowed with those 
      qualities, it is called vajra. As for the term yana, even when there is 
      delusion, all the vices, obscurations, and miseries of all sentient beings 
      do not worsen it, so it is self-upholding; and at the time of Spiritual 
      Awakening, all the primordial wisdoms and qualities of the realms of the 
      buddhas do not correct or improve it. Thus, since all good and evil 
      upholds itself, it is called yana.54 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Upon establishing all self-concepts 
      and delusive appearances as being of the empty nature of reality-itself, 
      the wisdom of realizing identitylessness is made manifest, and one 
      realizes the state of emptiness free of conceptual elaboration. That 
      realization is the most sublime of all states of consciousness, so </font>

      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">54The preceding discussion gives an 
      etymology of the term Vajrayana (Tib., rDo rje theg pa).&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 205 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">it is call wisdom. [298] As it 
      transcends knowledge and the objects of knowledge, it is called the 
      Perfection of Wisdom. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Now the unmanifest clear-light 
      nature of the minds of sentient beings is identified, and one ascertains 
      Ssamsara and nirvana as displays of that clear light. Thus, is it called 
      the clear light. The ultimate, indestructible vajra is of the nature of 
      the unified essence of all the jinas of the three times, so it is called 
      the essence.55</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Because it transcends all the 
      karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities of the cycle of 
      existence, it is called samsara and nirvana; and since all the phenomena 
      included in samsara and nirvana are completely included among the displays 
      of the suchness of reality-itself, one speaks of its being complete. 
      Because all the causes of samsara, nirvana, and the path and their effects 
      are totally perfected in the expanse of the great, pervasive 
      reality-itself, it is called perfect. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As it does not fall to the extreme 
      of birth, it is free of birth; as it does not fall to the extreme of 
      aging, it is free of aging; as it does not fall to the extreme of decline, 
      it is free of decline; and as it does not fall to the extreme of&nbsp; death, 
      it is free of death. That which is free of those is given the label of 
      youthful. The spontaneous displays of the great, inner luminosity of the 
      ground itself do not separate themselves off [from the ground], so the 
      label of vase is given.56 [299] </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As analogies, all the [reflections 
      of the] planets and stars do not separate themselves off from the expanse 
      of the ocean, and the entire animate and inanimate cosmos does not 
      separate itself off from the expanse of space. All the Dharmas of the 
      path, the various experiences of joyful and painful sensations, all the 
      displays of the fruitional embodiments and primordial wisdoms, all the 
      causal virtues of accumulating merit, and all their resultant appearances 
      of joy are without differentiation perfected in the ground-sugatagarbha 
      itself; so it is called the embodiment. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">55 The above paragraph gives an 
      etymology of the clear light essence (Tib. 'od gsal snying po). <br>
      56 The above paragraph gives an etymology of the youthful vase (Tib. gzhon 
      nu'i bum pa). </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 206 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">The mode of existence of the 
      dharmakaya. the awareness that is present as the ground, cannot be 
      fathomed by the intellect; it cannot be analyzed by the mind; it 
      transcends objects of articulation; and it subsumes everything, so it is 
      known as the bindu. Whatever aspects of samsara and nirvana appear, they 
      are of one taste in the fundamental, original, primordial ground, so it is 
      called sole. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">The great expanse of the pervasive 
      reality-itself of the whole of samsara and nirvana, free of a center or 
      periphery, dissolves into its inner luminosity and the state of vivid, 
      great, primordial wisdom is naturally clear, so it is called the clear 
      light. The ultimate vajra of the nature of indestructibility, the 
      essential nature of the unified essence of all the jinas of the three 
      times, [300] is called the essence.57 Because it is not confined to any 
      region and does not fall to any extreme, it is called the center . Because 
      it views samsara and nirvana as apparitions of the mind and is the agent 
      who dwells within, such that it is as if its emanations were sent forth 
      outside, it is called the consciousness of Mahamudra. All those, too, are 
      simply facets of the ground. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Even when the ground is reduced to 
      something ethically neutral, all the displays of the embodiments and 
      primordial wisdoms are none other than self-arisen, naturally perfect, 
      inner displays of the ground itself. So that is called the Great 
      Perfection of the time of the ground. As for the Great Perfection of the 
      time of the path, when the awareness that is present as the ground becomes 
      manifest, it dissolves into unmodified, ordinary mental states and 
      appearances; so ordinary mental states and appearances are perfected. 
      Since reality-itself does not lend itself to the extreme of nihilism, the 
      extremists' view of substantialism is&nbsp; perfected; and since it is not 
      apprehended as the extreme of the substantialist view, it perfects the 
      mind that seeks the path of the nihilistic view. Even if suffering, its 
      source, cessation, and the path are held to be substantial objects, by
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">57The above paragraph gives an 
      etymology of the clear light vajra essence (Tib. 'od gsal rdo rje'i snying

      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">realizing personal identitylessness, 
      realizing that they do not exist from one's own side, the Sravakayana is 
      perfected. By realizing the nature of all appearances and mental states of 
      the three realms as [301] dependently related events, the 
      Pratyekabuddhayana is perfected. By ascertaining that appearances are not 
      other than the mind, the Cittamatrayana is perfected. By realizing the 
      meaning of the two types of identitylessness, the Perfection of Wisdom is 
      perfected; by sealing samsara and nirvana with the Spirit of Awakening, 
      the Bodhisattvayana is perfected; and by that very realization of samsara 
      and nirvana as great emptiness becoming the universal ground of all middle 
      ways, those are all perfected. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">By not confounding one's actions 
      and conduct with the ordinary, the Kriyayana is perfected; by behaving 
      such that one's view and conduct are nondual, the Caryatantrayana is 
      perfected; by recognizing the view as being of greatest importance, the 
      Yogayana is perfected; by realizing the nondual reality of the deity and 
      one's own appearance, the whole of the Mahayogayana is perfected; by 
      realizing the nonduality of the absolute nature and primordial wisdom, the 
      whole of the Anuyana is perfected; by letting all that appears to the mind 
      vanish with modification, just as it is, the Mind Division [of Atiyoga] is 
      perfected; and by realizing the nonduality of the absolute nature and 
      awareness, the Expanse Division Yana is perfected in the dharmakaya, the 
      awareness that is present as the ground. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">The realization just how all the 
      Dharmas of those yanas are perfected&nbsp; [302] is called the Secret Precept 
      Yana. Since that is the great, universal ground of all the yanas, and 
      since all grounds and paths are simultaneously perfected, it is called the 
      Supreme Yana of the Great Perfection, which synthesizes the essence. For 
      other yanas are merely facets of the Great Perfection, and those who 
      adhere to&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">their own yana are certainly 
      limited, like taking a drop from the ocean and maintaining that as the 
      ocean. The vinaya and the Sravakayana are for those with low-inferior 
      faculties; the Pratyekabuddhayana is for those with medium-inferior 
      faculties; the Bodhisattvayana is for those with high-inferior faculties; 
      the Kriyayana is for those with low-middling faculties; the Upayayana is 
      for those of medium-middling faculties; the Yogayana is for those with 
      high-middling faculties; Mahayoga is for those with low-superior 
      faculties; Anuyoga is for those with medium-superior faculties; and the 
      three divisions of Atiyoga are for those with high-superior faculties. 
      Among them, the Mind Division Yana is taught to those with low-superior 
      faculties; the Expanse Division Yana is taught to those with 
      medium-superior faculties; and the Secret Precept Division is taught to 
      the highest of the high. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">In accordance with each 
      individual's own faculties and merit, it is taught that a single person 
      may proceed along the grounds and paths of liberation. [303] On the other 
      hand, even though there are no differences in quality or magnitude in the 
      fundamental minds of sentient beings, one speaks as if there were 
      differences in the quality of their faculties due to their domination by 
      self-grasping and their resultant failure to realize the meaning of 
      identitylessness. The succession of yanas is taught as a path of gradual 
      procession, like walking up a staircase. Know that it is not as if some 
      were on the ground floor, utterly incapable of ascending due to a closed 
      skylight; nor is it as if some were up above from the outset, so that they 
      need not descend, like planets and stars that have risen into the sky. 
      Rather, by the power of one's previous training, whatever yana one 
      encounters, one's karmic momentum for that will&nbsp; gradually be aroused.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">O Vidyavajra, in this 
      reality-itself of the primordially pure Great Perfection called the 
      dharmakaya awareness that is present as the ground, seven wisdoms are 
      naturally perfected. These are the seven: </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">1. The one-taste nature of all 
      phenomena included in the universe of&nbsp; samsara and nirvana, as displays of 
      the suchness of reality-itself, is veiled by afflictive and cognitive 
      obscurations, so it is reduced to something&nbsp; ethically neutral. In 
      contrast to the delusion of the mind succumbing to dualistic grasping, by 
      investigating and analyzing the nature of existence of things, one 
      recognizes their non-objective, open nature. [304] That is called 
      discerning wisdom. That realizes the emptiness of every single phenomenon 
      that seems to appear from its own side. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">2. Finally, stabilization in the 
      mind-stream that ascertains the identitylessness and emptiness of all the 
      phenomena of samsara and nirvana is called the wisdom of realizing 
      identitylessness. That utterly dissolves the grasping onto the reality of 
      appearances. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">3. Truly knowing the manner in 
      which all the Dharmas of the path and fruition are naturally perfected in 
      the ground itself is called the wisdom of knowing reality as it is. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">4. Planets and stars in the ocean 
      appearing due to the limpidity and clarity of the water, and the entire 
      animate and inanimate universe and sensory objects appearing from the 
      limpidity and clarity of space do not appear in the absence of that 
      limpidity and clarity. And just as reflections do not appear without the 
      limpidity and clarity of a mirror, appearances of the whole of samsara and 
      nirvana would not occur without the limpidity and clarity of the ground. 
      Thus, by apprehending that limpidity and clarity as real things, 
      appearances occur. Truly realizing that is an unsurpassed feature of the 
      Great Perfection.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 210 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As an analogy, the planets and 
      stars in the ocean are not different from the water, and the entire 
      animate and inanimate universe is not different from space. [305] 
      Likewise, there is nothing in the whole of samsara and nirvana that is not 
      unified with and pervaded by the primordial wisdom of the awareness of 
      reality-itself. That is called pervasive, all-seeing, great wisdom, and it 
      perceives the whole of samsara and nirvana like reflections of the moon in 
      water. Realizing that with great wisdom, one remains in this profundity 
      within oneself.</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">5. By apprehending the ground 
      itself as the ground,58 the samsara of impure karma is released into the 
      absolute nature, and one's own face of the dharmakaya is perceived. That 
      is called the wisdom of release. By totally disengaging from all activity 
      , one dwells in inactivity. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">6. All clinging onto the 
      appearances of the samsara of impure, dualistic grasping is forcefully 
      unified with the great, pure equality, so that is called the wisdom of 
      unification. One knows the homogenous non- existence of all good and bad 
      and of all objects of hope and fear. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">7. By realizing all phenomena as 
      expressions of the one great emptiness, the whole of delusive samsara of 
      impure karma and mental afflictions is totally vanquished and incinerated, 
      so that is called the wisdom of vanquishing. It perceives emptiness and 
      fathoms its depths. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">O son of good breeding, great 
      wisdom is like the fire at the end of the eon, which destroys the cosmos. 
      [306] Like dry grass burned in a fire, all karma, mental afflictions, 
      habitual propensities, and delusive appearances are incinerated in 
      reality-itself, which transcends causality. Great wisdom is like the sun 
      rising in the sky, utterly dispelling all the darkness of ignorance. Great 
      wisdom is like space, for it makes one comprehend all sublime Dharmas just 
      as [space] penetrates the animate and inanimate universe. In the first 
      instant, blind sentient </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">_______________</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">58 The meaning here is that by 
      apprehending where one is in one's practice, by recognizing the ground (Tib. 
      sa) one stands on, one is ready to proceed further in one's practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 211 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">beings are tormented and entrapped 
      in the sufferings of samsarra and the miserable states of existence, and 
      mental afflictions and habitual propensities become like a sack of poison. 
      In the second instant, simply by identifying great wisdom, they become 
      equal in fortune to the dharmakaya, Samantabhadra, and they become worthy 
      of the homage, worship, and devotion of myriads of living beings, 
      including the gods. They become fields of merit and the foremost of 
      assemblies. This destroys eons of impure karma, and that is ultimate.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Conventionally, it is said there 
      are seven conflagrations at the end of the eon that destroy the cosmos. 
      There are seven pure energies of primordial wisdom. These are those seven 
      energies: [307]</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">1. Dispersive energy courses 
      through each of the domains of the mental states and appearances of the 
      impure cycle of existence, and it dissolves into emptiness one's clinging 
      onto them as permanent, stable, and immutable. It extends out to all 
      appearing objects and enables one to recognize their lack of true 
      existence. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">2. The whole of samsara and nirvana 
      is permeated by the ground, and the pervasive energy causes that ground to 
      become manifest. By leaving it in its own state, without meditating, one's 
      own essential nature is perceived. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">3. The binding energy of wisdom is 
      so called, for it fastens the avenues of the impure mind to emptiness, the 
      great center; and it apprehends one's own nature in great, 
      intellect-transcending ineffability. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">4. The apprehending energy of 
      skillful means embraces reality-itself, free of conceptual elaboration in 
      the great, primordial rest that transcends the intellect; and it merges 
      continuously with ineffability. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">5. The energy that destroys the 
      cosmos is so called, for in the end it dissolves all these appearances 
      into great, non-objective, primordially pure&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 212 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">reality-itself, and annihilates 
      them; and it casts them into the great extinction of phenomena, which 
      transcends the intellect. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">6. The merciless, karmic energy of 
      the eon is so called, for, due to the all pervasive movement of this 
      energy of primordial wisdom, the vitality of samsara is cut off and cast 
      into the absolute nature of nirvana. Mental states and appearances arise 
      as emptiness, and finally they are cast into the absolute nature, in which 
      delusion is unknown. [308] </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">7. The fire-accompanying energy is 
      so called, for it utterly eradicates the darkness of ignorance and totally 
      incinerates all karma, mental afflictions, and habitual propensities. 
      Banishing mental afflictions and ideation into the absolute nature, the 
      vitality of omniscience courses as primordial wisdom. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Thus, the seven great energies of 
      pure, primordial wisdom slay the karmic energies right where they are. Due 
      to the movement and resting of the energies of primordial wisdom in their 
      own place, one swiftly reaches the state of omniscient, perfect Spiritual 
      Awakening. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Thus, the luminosity of the 
      essential nature, emptiness, is called wisdom, and its power of 
      self-illumination is called energy. This demonstrates the manner in which 
      the whole range of paths and fruitions are perfected in the dharmakaya, 
      the awareness that is present as the ground. So that one may recognize the 
      supremacy of the spiritual vehicle of the clear light Great Perfection, 
      the essential points of this one vehicle are repeated again and again; for 
      if they were not taught, they would not be correctly realized. That is why 
      they are taught in this way. Consequently, future disciples will fathom 
      these essential points and all doubts will be vanquished. That is called 
      the essential nature, or core, of meditation, the razor that cuts off 
      error, [309] the sole eye of primordial wisdom, and the vast expanse of 
      the space of the view. Know this!&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">&nbsp;Page 213 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the blind who are ignorant 
      of this, the reason why they do not ascend beyond the higher realms, 
      regardless of how much they meditate, is that they do not recognize or 
      know the primordially pure ground, the all-pervasive nature of being. 
      Ignorance is the delusive ground of the three realms, so they do not 
      ascend beyond the cycle of existence. Genuine knowledge of the nondual, 
      one taste of the great, original, primordial ground of samsara and nirvana 
      is called the primordial wisdom of awareness. Know that all the 
      collections of virtue created by that ground are solely results of 
      omniscient, perfect Spiritual Awakening!&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Bodhisattva Vidyavajra then 
      commented, &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, over lifetimes from beginningless time up 
      to the present, due to the cause of ignorance and the contributing 
      condition of dualistic grasping, blind sentient beings of the three realms 
      continuously, incessantly cling to delusive cycles in the endless abodes 
      of samsara. Under the domination of the condensed contaminations of 
      habitual propensities within the shell of ignorance, [310] they are 
      oppressed by great burdens of suffering. But by the power of wisdom and 
      primordial wisdom, the shell of habitual propensities is opened up. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Before awakening from the slumber 
      of ignorance, one reifies the delusive sense of experiencing the miseries 
      of the cycle of existence and the miserable states of existence, which 
      were in fact not experienced. Considering the way one clings to 
      experiences, this is laughable! How so? While the bases of designations 
      are not established, different names are designated upon non-objective 
      emptiness, and in that way one deceives oneself. Ha ha! All appearing 
      phenomena are like mirages taken to be water, and like an illusory 
      festival that one takes to be permanent and clings to it, as if it were 
      one's own possession. Former appearances vanish and later ones arise, with 
      no enduring presence, but by not noticing this, one is bewildered, Ha ha!&nbsp;
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 214 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Not recognizing the problem that 
      appearances arise and transform with no stability, one takes pride in 
      one's accumulated possessions as if they were one's eternal wealth. Ha ha!
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When one sees samsara and nirvana 
      as the open, non-objective nature of great emptiness, [311] all the 
      buddhas and buddha-fields that are taken to be objects in the animate and 
      inanimate universe fall into an abyss. Ha ha! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When one sees that all animate and 
      inanimate worlds with all their sense objects are totally groundless and 
      rootless like a dream and an illusion, and when one sees that they seem to 
      exist even though they do not, and that they simultaneously emerge and 
      vanish in an instant like a flash of lightning, the cycle of samsara is 
      blown away by the wind. Ha ha! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Not recognizing the fact that over 
      beginningless lifetimes one's own nature has never wavered even for an 
      instant from the primordially pure, absolute nature of reality, it seems 
      that one comes and goes and moves about in the cycle of existence. Ha ha!
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Not recognizing the fact that over 
      beginningless lifetimes one's own appearances arise to oneself, and apart 
      from them there has never been even an iota of any sensory object, one 
      takes the experienced appearances onto which one clings as being other 
      than oneself; then one is constantly deluded by taking on hopes and fears. 
      Ha ha! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When one encounters one's own face 
      as the great, original, primordial ground, one awakens to the unimpeded 
      non-objectivity of all faults and habitual propensities. Ha ha! </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When one sees the absolute nature 
      of the ground, free of conceptual elaboration, the aid and injury brought 
      about by gods and demons and by friends and enemies vanish without a 
      trace. Ha ha!&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 215 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When the darkness of not knowing 
      the absolute nature of the ground [312] is replaced by knowledge, 
      Spiritual Awakening is not achieved by the good of meditation nor does one 
      wander in the cycle of existence due to the deficiency of not meditating. 
      Ha ha! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When the ground dharmakaya. the 
      Omnipresent Lord, Samantabhadra becomes manifest, one effortlessly attains 
      the kingdom of the dharmakaya. Ha ha! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When one gains mastery over the 
      primordial wisdom of awareness free of extremes, without needing to view 
      or consider all sentient beings of the three realms, and without needing 
      to exert strenuous effort, one simultaneously Awakens to reality-itself, 
      the absolute nature that transcends causality. Ha ha! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When one gains mastery over the 
      primordial wisdom of awareness free of extremes, every single one of the 
      innumerable mandalas of the jinas are perfected and actualized as one 
      taste, without convergence or divergence. Ha ha! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When the pure, homogenous displays 
      of samsara and nirvana and the dharmakaya, awareness that is present as 
      the ground, are perceived, one instantly becomes perfectly Awakened, 
      without reliance upon the stages of the grounds and paths. Ha ha!&quot; </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">By hearing the sound of the words 
      of that great vajra laughter, one will fathom the real, absolute nature, 
      and realize those vast and profound points.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Bodhisattva Vidyavajra then asked, 
      &quot;O Teacher, Bhagavan, omnipresent Lord, Immutable Sovereign, [313] 
      original buddha of the ground, how does one practice the path of your 
      nature, called the Great Perfection? May the Teacher explain!&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">He replied, &quot;O son of good 
      breeding, this is the way to practice the path of my nature, the Great 
      Perfection. To proceed along the grounds and paths of liberation in this 
      life, first you must know the reasons for the difficulty of obtaining a 
      precious human life of leisure and endowment, and those reasons must be 
      firmly imprinted in your mind-stream.&nbsp; In terms of the demarcation between 
      samsara and nirvana, if you do not practice Dharma right now, you will not 
      encounter the grounds and paths of liberation later on; and even if you 
      meet with them, you will find it difficult to know how to put them into 
      practice. It is difficult to encounter a spiritual mentor, or sublime 
      spiritual friend, who can introduce you [to awareness]. It is very 
      difficult to have the freedom to practice, and it is hard to assemble all 
      the necessities of life and things [needed for practice]. Except for right 
      now, the methods for gaining freedom from the imprisoning pit of the 
      miseries of samsara will not come along again. Knowing this, you must see 
      that your spiritual practice engages with the path. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Recognizing that the time of your 
      death is unpredictable, [314] consider that the thunderbolt of death may 
      strike at any time and in any situation, so right now you are on the verge 
      of being catapulted away from the human realm to some other realm. Bearing 
      in mind all the miseries that will be experienced at that time, give this 
      command to your own mind: Today I will leave everything behind, including 
      my parents, relatives, home, and possessions, so they will remain just as 
      they are. From now on, I will not even hear their names, I will not see 
      even a fraction of them, and I will never return here again. When the time 
      of my departure comes, I will have no freedom to avoid going to a 
      destination in&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 217 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">which for eons I will be tossed 
      about by waves of suffering, without the slightest bit of happiness, and I 
      will be brought before the agents of the Lord of Death. A great hurricane 
      of the winds of karma will push me from behind, the faces of all my 
      relatives, children, and spouse will be covered with tears; and their 
      terrible cries of lamentation will aggravate my misery. Unable to let them 
      go, when I desperately, pathetically proceed alone, with no companion, to 
      an unknown destination, who will accompany me? Who will help carry the 
      burden of&nbsp; my misery? Who will come to my rescue? Who will experience for 
      me that unbearable suffering? What benefit will there be from the 
      non-virtuous, evil karma I have accumulated for the sake of my children, 
      relatives, and friends? [315] They will never recall my kindness. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Considering the examples of 
      yourself and others, if in this life you don't even set out on the path to 
      liberation, whatever you do will have no benefit whatsoever. The time of 
      your death is unknown. If everyone, including children, the young and the 
      old, must die, and if there is no way of determining when you will die, 
      then without procrastination you should quickly know&nbsp; the reasons for the 
      need to practice the profound, quintessential instructions on the sublime, 
      supreme spiritual vehicle for gaining liberation in one lifetime. And you 
      must apply yourself to them assiduously. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you ignore death, the thought of 
      Dharma will subside, and you will fall under the domination of spiritual 
      sloth, distractions, amusements, and hankering for material gain. In that 
      way your life will pass in vain, and you will slip into death as an 
      ordinary being, then fall into the endless cycle of existence. The 
      recollection of impermanence and death, by considering these points again 
      and again, is the unsurpassed, fundamental ground of the path to 
      liberation. Without this, like a person who is blind and crippled, you 
      succumb to detrimental karma&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 218 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">and situations, so even if you 
      practice Dharma, it will be feeble and will naturally unravel like a knot 
      in a horse's tail. So know this! </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Knowing those two points and 
      applying them to one's mind-stream, one should reflect upon karma and its 
      consequences. Bearing in mind the consequence of hatred is [316] hell, 
      just count the number of deeds you have committed that were motivated by 
      hatred! Do you sense that you will be a visitor in hell? Bearing in mind 
      that the consequence of attachment is the preta realm, just look at your 
      own attachment; and if you count the number of deeds you have committed 
      under its influence, do you understand that you will be a visitor in the 
      realm of pretas? Bearing in mind that the consequence of delusion is the 
      animal realm, if you examine the various foul deeds generated by that 
      cause, you will find that you have been pursuing the path leading to 
      becoming a visitor in the animal realm. Do you understand that your own 
      realm is definitely within the cycle of existence? Actions motivated by 
      jealousy lead to the realm of asuras, and if you reflect upon the ways you 
      have accumulated karma motivated by thoughts of jealousy, you will see 
      that the guests of the asuras pursue the causes of that realm, and they 
      return to their own realm again and again. Do you understand ? </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Evil, non-virtuous deeds motivated 
      by the three poisons of the afflicted mind include the three bodily 
      non-virtues of killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, [317] the four 
      verbal non-virtues of lying, slander, idle gossip, and abuse, and the 
      three mental non-virtues of avarice, malice, and false views. The power of 
      all these is generated by their causal motivations, and thus the 
      appearances of the three miserable states of existence emerge. In 
      particular, if your samayas degenerate regarding the root of Secret 
      Mantra, your spiritual mentor and friends, you must fall to the 
      excruciating realm known as Vajra-hell; so bear in mind that it is crucial 
      to know those samayas. If you think that no&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 219 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">faults are incurred for those who 
      do not know them, you are wrong. Those who are ignorant of them do not 
      recognize whether or not their samayas have degenerated, so they do not 
      take the opportunity to confess and purify them. In them great faults 
      unceasingly occur, and the consequences of their evil deeds stemming from 
      their ignorance and lack of awareness manifest in their own time. This is 
      like losing all one's accumulated food and possessions due to one's 
      ignorance of the presence of a thief. There is not the slightest 
      difference between that and knowingly being robbed of them by a bandit in 
      broad daylight. Likewise, in terms of the karmic consequences and the 
      experience of suffering, [318] there is not even the slightest difference 
      between those who are knowledgeable and those who are not.&nbsp; Those who know 
      the samayas immediately understand when an infraction occurs, and by 
      confessing it, they either purify it or diminish its harm. Those who do 
      not know the samayas are unaware of infractions when they occur, so they 
      continue to compound all their faults, downfalls, and broken samayas. By 
      so doing, the infractions grow and increase, and they are never purified.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">O son of good breeding, until you 
      reach the state of the great, intellect transcending extinction of 
      phenomena, examine the manner in which karma ripens, without ever simply 
      disappearing, and unerringly practice adopting virtues and abstaining from 
      vices. Recognize the tremendous importance of this, and guard it as you do 
      your own life. In particular, you must bear in mind the importance of 
      abstaining from even the subtlest of vices and non-virtues. If you do not, 
      and you become confused with regard to non-virtuous conduct, gradually the 
      power of evil deeds will grow until eventually, due to the subtle relation 
      between actions and their results, various contaminations of habitual 
      propensities will combine, enormous consequences will emerge, and they 
      will&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 220 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">inexorably carry you away. 
      Therefore, knowledge of the significance of actions and their consequences 
      is like eyes that enable you to see the path. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Upon considering the nature of 
      suffering of the cycle of existence, recognize that the cycle of existence 
      is like a fire-pit, like a viper's nest, and like [319] a land of raksasas, 
      without the slightest opportunity for happiness, and apply yourself to the 
      pursuit of liberation. Bear in mind the indispensability of generating 
      that attitude before engaging in the practice of Dharma. For those who do 
      not train their minds in that way, even if they try to implement the 
      profound practical instructions, as soon as difficulties and little things 
      like hunger and thirst occur, they give up and fail to carry the practice 
      through to its culmination. Thus, after you have first trained in the Four 
      Thoughts that Turn the Mind, it is vital that you bear these in mind 
      constantly, without forgetting them, at all times and in all situations. 
      Doing so is the unsurpassed crown-jewel of all Dharma practitioners.
      </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Now as for the main practice, 
      genuine knowledge and realization of the one taste of the whole of samsara 
      and nirvana in the ocean of the original ground is called the view of the 
      vast expanse of space, and that entails the manifestation of your own 
      nature as the dharmakaya, devoid of signs. As for meditation, throughout 
      beginningless lifetimes in the cycle of existence, the original, 
      primordial ground, Samantabhadra, has pervaded the mind-streams of all 
      sentient beings, just as sesame oil pervades sesame seeds. However, under 
      the influence of dualistic grasping and clinging to true existence, the 
      mind becomes dimmed, as if by darkness, and deluded. [320] But now, apart 
      from&nbsp; identifying your own nature, there is nothing whatsoever on which to 
      meditate, and you gain freedom for yourself. As a result of holding your 
      own ground, freedom is experienced in the domain of pristine space, 
      unstructured and unmodified by the</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page&nbsp;221 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">intellect; and you are infinitely 
      immersed in great, self-arisen, primordial rest. This is like space 
      merging with space. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Previously, your intellect 
      demarcated outer from inner and grasped onto them as being distinct. Now 
      you ascertain that there is no outer and inner, and you come upon the 
      nature of great, all-pervasive openness, and that is called meditation 
      free of the intellect and devoid of activity. In the state of such 
      meditation, motionlessly rest your body, without modifying it, like a 
      corpse in a charnel ground. Not modifying the voice entails dispensing 
      with all speech and recitations, as if your voice were a lute on which the 
      strings have been severed. Not modifying the mind entails naturally 
      releasing it in the state of primordial being, without altering it in any 
      way. These three involve dispensing with activities of the body, speech, 
      and mind and settling in meditative equipoise that is devoid of activity 
      .For that reason, this is called meditative equipoise.</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Whenever engaging in any kind of 
      physical or verbal activity such as eating, lying down, walking, sitting, 
      or being in the marketplace or crowds of people, maintain the constant 
      awareness of ascertaining ail things as displays of the nonduality of 
      samsara and nirvana, without ever losing the power of this view. [321] 
      Never waver from the state of manifest awareness, devoid of action, in 
      which the inner depths of meditation are not forsaken. Abstain from the 
      sins of nonvirtuous actions as if they were poison, never allowing your 
      conduct to slip into carelessness. As for your physical conduct, act 
      slowly and serenely, firmly and resolutely, like a clay statue. When 
      walking, move deliberately,&nbsp; taking each step in an easygoing manner. Let 
      your demeanor be like that of a lion, without turning your head around or 
      glancing quickly to the right or left. When rising, get up slowly, not 
      abruptly, and when eating, chew and swallow deliberately, not like a yak 
      gobbling down grass. When conversing with others, abstain from flippant 
      speech, and speak gently and slowly. Adjust your speech&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 222 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">so that you express the truth, 
      speaking pleasantly and deliberately, without disturbing the minds of 
      others. Let your mind be calm, subdued, and spacious, without succumbing 
      to emotional vacillations. Having kind thoughts and&nbsp; great altruism and 
      speaking and behaving without deviousness or self aggrandizement is the 
      way to bring your mind to Dharma. [322] </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">In particular, as a sign of your 
      own great defects you may see everyone as being flawed, without perceiving 
      anyone as being faultless. This perception is like that of people seeing 
      everything as snakes as a result of have eaten dhadhura, or those 
      suffering from a bile disorder seeing a conch as yellow. People seen and 
      experienced as being different from yourself are invariably perceived as 
      being imperfect, while you see no faults in those who are close to you, 
      such as your brothers, sisters, nephews, and uncles. They are invariably 
      regarded as being good. That is seeing your own side as divine and the 
      other side as demonic. Stop it! View everyone as being flawless, and 
      recognize all&nbsp; defects as your own. That is a crucial aspect of your 
      conduct. When you possess status and prestige, do not disregard all those 
      who are weak, powerless, impoverished, or timid; for if you fail to behave 
      amicably with everyone, there is the possibility that such misfortune will 
      eventually befall you, and they will all rise up against you in anger. As 
      conditions degenerate, all those in positions of royalty, power, and 
      wealth eventually fall to inferior stations and poverty. Upon examining 
      this matter, bear no malice toward anyone. [323] That is crucial. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">When high status, prestige, and 
      affluence come your way, adopt a sense of humility and overcome any sense 
      of pride; and when you find yourself meeting misfortune and terrible 
      surroundings, do not let your inner strength wane, but bring forth the 
      inner depths of your view and meditation; and release your consciousness 
      without an object, as if you were an insane person who has become 
      agitated. Moreover, knowing appearances to be like illusions and&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 223 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">dreams is another crucial aspect of 
      your conduct. On occasions of joy and happiness, avoid self-conscious 
      pride, and at times of hunger, cold, and thirst, bring forth the strength 
      of your mind and the depths of the view. Do not utter words of abuse or 
      slander toward anyone, but apply yourself to equanimity. On the other 
      hand, do not flatter others either, but remain at rest, for the end result 
      of reviling and glorifying others is that when those you have praised 
      offend you, you will want to put them down, and when those you have 
      insulted support you, you will be compelled to commend them. Then others 
      will ridicule you, and your own flaws will become apparent. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you deny the excellent qualities 
      and speak of the faults of your enemies and opponents, even though 
      everyone knows of their talents and virtues, others will become disgusted 
      with you and think of these problems as your own. [324] Thus, since your 
      abusive words inflict no harm [upon your enemies], stop saying them. 
      Moreover, by extolling the virtues of your defective friends and 
      relatives, everyone will despise and ridicule you. Thus, the importance of 
      avoiding that is another crucial aspect of your conduct. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As a result of lying, you fall into 
      disgrace, everyone despises you as if you were dog meat, no matter what 
      you say, people take it to be a lie, and you do not make it to the rank of 
      a human being. If you steal or break an oath, even though others may 
      pretend not to know about it, secretly they all come to gossip about it 
      and vilify you for it; so abstain from such conduct. If you engage in 
      disgusted, adversarial contempt or abuse toward any spiritual mentor or 
      teacher, your path to liberation will be blocked, and this will become an 
      enormous weight bearing you down to the miserable states of existence. As 
      taught in the tantras, the scriptures, and practical instructions, even at 
      the cost of your life and body, do not succumb to the slightest bit of 
      such behavior. This is the root of Dharma, so bear it in mind as something 
      of the geatest importance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 224 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">By being attracted and addicted to 
      talking and gossiping and seeing benefit in savoring words, your life may 
      be spent in vain, and for the most part such talk becomes the basis for 
      bickering, disputation, and irritation. This is pointless, so dispense 
      with such entertainment and apply yourself to meditation. Even if you had 
      a galaxy filled with food and wealth, you would never be satisfied, so for 
      the duration [325] of this human life, which is but a momentary dream, you 
      should be content simply that you are not dying of starvation, regardless 
      of how much food you have; and be satisfied with being protected from the 
      elements, regardless of the quality of your clothes. For the most part, 
      food and clothing are detrimental objects of attachment which at the time 
      of death lead to rebirth as demons. They are called possessions because 
      they possess you to take birth in miserable states of existence and the 
      cycle of existence, so even their name indicates their causal influence. 
      Friends venture forth into Dharma, taking their own measure of things, 
      without heeding anyone's advice. No one but a qualified spiritual mentor 
      can provide them with counsel that will be of lasting benefit to them, so 
      heed your spiritual mentor's guidance as a life-long pledge. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Think of sentient beings who 
      constantly strive with great diligence and courage, enduring all manner of 
      hardships, for projects that cast them down into the endless cycle of 
      existence. With them in mind, willingly accept the hardships involved in 
      applying yourself to methods that bring eternal bliss. Cast behind you 
      that which is easy. Set up your body and vitality as targets. Sacrifice 
      your flesh and blood as food. If you do not constantly apply yourself to 
      generating courage and fortitude, arouse yourself by thinking, &quot;I shall 
      die in awhile.&quot; Whatever Dharma you practice, attend to the benefit of all 
      sentient beings and apply yourself wholeheartedly to arduous virtues, 
      without showing off or using pretense in order to gain others' admiration 
      or praise. [326]&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 225 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for your pledges and vows, be 
      guileless. Do not disparage Dharma or individuals. Treating everyone 
      impartially, without fawning on those in high positions or denigrating 
      those in low positions, is the conduct of Dharma practitioners. Do not 
      deceive others. Do not offend the faithful. Do not beguile the minds of 
      those applying themselves to virtue. Do not partake of the food and wealth 
      meant for those practicing in meditative retreat. By diligently applying 
      yourself to practice, without letting the practical guidance you have 
      received fade away, qualified spiritual mentors will not rebuke you. By 
      being completely candid about your pledges and vows, the gods and 
      guardians will not rebuke you. By saturating your life with Dharma, 
      without pretense or hypocrisy, you will have no cause to rebuke yourself. 
      That is the practice of the jinas, and their followers should maintain 
      this as the best of practices. For the duration of this fleeting human 
      life, there is no time or leisure for pursuing such things as high status, 
      power, or wealth. Abstain from self-praise and pretense motivated by the 
      desire for fame and status, and hold in your heart the awareness of your 
      own mortality. Never forsaking the precious Three Jewels is the sublime 
      foundation and root of the practice. Modify your physical and verbal 
      conduct in those ways, and be on guard not to fall into carelessness. 
      Attend to this! Realize it! Cleave to it! That is the crucial guidance for 
      post-meditative experience. [327] Carrying through with the practice of 
      meditative equipoise and post-meditative practice in the above manner 
      until you die is the sublime essence of the practice. </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">As for the essence of your conduct, 
      do not forsake the view in the midst of your daily activities. Even though 
      you strive in cultivating physical and verbal virtues and accumulate an 
      enormous amount of merit, if you discard the practice of the profound view 
      and meditation, when you face death you will do so as an ordinary person; 
      and your practice will have sustained and compounded the&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">Page 226 </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">cycle of existence. Thus, you may 
      experience merely the temporary joys of gods and humans, but the fruits of 
      liberation will remain beyond reach. Thus, due to that failure you will 
      remain in bondage. Therefore, once you have achieved the stability of 
      confidence in the profound view and meditation, virtuous qualities of the 
      body and speech that can be seen or heard cannot replace the authentic 
      view and meditation. As an analogy, when the lion, king of beasts, 
      haughtily gazes out over the snowy mountains, no other creature can stand 
      up to him. You must recognize the importance of not allowing the view and 
      meditation to be lost as you come under other influences. If you lose the 
      view in the midst of your daily activities, know that this is like a king 
      losing his realm to someone else. [328] </font></p>
      <p><font face color="#000066" size="4">If you forsake proper conduct in 
      favor of the view, you will fall under the influence of negligence, like 
      maras and rudras, and out of your addiction to activities of the cycle of 
      existence, a great current of sinful actions will emerge, resulting in 
      false views regarding the Three Jewels and disregard for the moral 
      consequences of your actions. As you fail to implement the ultimate view 
      and meditation, you will not even have the means to accumulate merit for 
      attaining the state of gods or humans. That is like veering from a path on 
      which you are seeking healing medicinal herbs and running into a plant 
      that is poisonous to the touch. In such a case, it is said that friends 
      turn into maras. It is the profound view that cures the terrible chronic 
      disease of the sufferings of the cycle of existence, but if it leads your 
      mind onto paths of iniquity, it will make you experience the endless 
      miseries of samsara. The remedy for ignorance is knowledge, and the remedy 
      for samsara is the view and meditation; but as a result of not 
      implementing them, if they result in your mind becoming filled with 
      misconceptions and behavior contrary to&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
